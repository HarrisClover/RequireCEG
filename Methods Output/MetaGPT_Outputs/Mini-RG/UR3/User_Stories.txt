- As a parent, I want to check if a clothing size will fit my child so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.
- As a shopper, I want to know if boy's clothes can fit a girl (or vice versa) so that I can maximize clothing options.
- As a retail associate, I want to quickly validate size compatibility so that I can assist customers effectively.
