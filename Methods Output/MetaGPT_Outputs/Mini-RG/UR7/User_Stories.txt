1. As a website user, I want to earn rewards for my activities so that I feel motivated to use the platform more frequently.
2. As a casual visitor, I want to understand the reward system benefits so that I can decide whether to participate.
3. As an engaged user, I want to track my reward progress so that I can plan my website activities.
4. As a privacy-conscious user, I want to opt out of the reward system so that I can use the website without participating.
