### 2.2 User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to access free API endpoints without authentication so that I can quickly test the API functionality
2. As an API consumer, I want to use my API key to access protected endpoints so that I can integrate secure features into my iOS app
3. As an enterprise user, I want to manage API access permissions so that I can control which features my team can access
4. As a system administrator, I want to monitor API key usage and validity so that I can maintain security and prevent unauthorized access

### 3.4 Open Questions

1. What should be the default API key expiration period?
2. Should we implement a grace period for expired keys?
3. How should we handle API version compatibility?
4. What metrics should we track for API usage?
5. Should we implement automatic key rotation?

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 API Key Format
- Must use secure random generation
- Should include prefix for key type identification
- Must be at least 32 characters long

### 4.2 Authentication Flow
1. Client sends API key in request header
2. System validates key format and expiration
3. System checks permissions
4. If valid, process request
5. If invalid, return appropriate error

### 4.3 Error Handling

Must implement following error responses:
- 401: Invalid API key
- 403: Insufficient permissions
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- 400: Malformed request

### 4.4 Security Measures

1. Transport Security:
- MUST use HTTPS for all API endpoints
- MUST implement TLS 1.2 or higher

2. Key Storage:
- MUST hash API keys before storage
- MUST encrypt sensitive data

## 5. Success Metrics

1. Technical Metrics:
- API response time < 100ms
- System uptime > 99.9%
- Zero security breaches

2. Business Metrics:
- Developer adoption rate
- API usage growth
- Customer satisfaction score
