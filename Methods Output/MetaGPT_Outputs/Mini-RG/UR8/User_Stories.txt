1. As a developer, I want to access free API endpoints without authentication so that I can quickly test the API functionality.
2. As an API consumer, I want to use my API key to access protected endpoints so that I can integrate secure features into my iOS app.
3. As an enterprise user, I want to manage API access permissions so that I can control which features my team can access.
4. As a system administrator, I want to monitor API key usage and validity so that I can maintain security and prevent unauthorized access.
