# IP Address Blocking System PRD

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Project Information
- Project Name: ip_blocking_system
- Programming Language: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- Original Requirements: Implement a system to block specific users based on IP address to prevent website spamming

### 1.2 Product Goals
1. Provide robust IP-based access control to prevent spam and malicious activities
2. Enable efficient management of IP blocking lists
3. Ensure seamless user experience while maintaining security

### 1.3 User Stories
1. As an administrator, I want to add IP addresses to a blocking list so that I can prevent malicious users from accessing the website
2. As an administrator, I want to manage (view/edit/delete) blocked IP addresses so that I can maintain an up-to-date blocking list
3. As a system, I want to automatically check user IP addresses against the blocking list so that blocked users are denied access
4. As an administrator, I want to see the history of blocked IP activities so that I can monitor blocking effectiveness
