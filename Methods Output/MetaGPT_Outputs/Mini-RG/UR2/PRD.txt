### 3.4 User Flow

1. Account Creation Flow:
   - User visits registration page
   - Enters email and password
   - System validates input
   - Account created
   - Email verification sent

2. Profile Creation Flow:
   - User logs in with credentials
   - Navigates to profile creation
   - Fills required information
   - Uploads profile picture (optional)
   - Saves profile

3. Authentication Flow:
   - User attempts profile access
   - System checks for valid session
   - If invalid, redirects to login
   - After login, grants profile access

### 3.5 Open Questions

1. Security Considerations
   - What are the password complexity requirements?
   - Should we implement rate limiting for login attempts?
   - What is the session timeout duration?

2. Profile Requirements
   - What profile fields are mandatory vs optional?
   - Are there any content restrictions for profile fields?
   - What file types are allowed for profile pictures?

3. Technical Decisions
   - Which authentication library should we use?
   - How should we handle data persistence?
   - What's the proper error handling strategy?

## 4. Success Metrics
