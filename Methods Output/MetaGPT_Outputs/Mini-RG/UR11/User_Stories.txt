1. As an administrator, I want to manage user permissions for transaction history access so that I can control data access based on user roles.
2. As a user with full permissions, I want to view and save transaction records so that I can maintain comprehensive transaction documentation.
3. As a user with view-only permission, I want to create personal transaction records so that I can track important transactions for my reference.
4. As a system auditor, I want to verify user permissions and access logs so that I can ensure compliance with security protocols.
