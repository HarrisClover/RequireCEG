# Interactive Web Application PRD

## 1. Project Information
- Project Name: interactive_scenario_simulator
- Programming Language: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- Original Requirements: Development of an interactive web application supporting user interactions through button clicks and drag-and-drop operations, with user authentication and parallel execution capabilities.

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals
1. Create a robust and responsive web application for simulating user interaction scenarios
2. Implement secure user authentication and session management
3. Demonstrate system capability to handle parallel operations efficiently

### 2.2 User Stories
1. As a new user, I want to create an account and log in so that I can access the drag-and-drop functionality
2. As an authenticated user, I want to interact with numbered buttons in various combinations so that I can test different scenarios
3. As an authenticated user, I want to perform drag-and-drop operations and receive immediate feedback so that I can confirm successful interactions
4. As a system tester, I want to execute multiple scenarios simultaneously to verify system performance and responsiveness

### 2.3 Competitive Analysis

1. Selenium IDE
   - Pros: Comprehensive test recording, browser automation
   - Cons: Limited parallel execution, no built-in authentication handling

2. Cypress
   - Pros: Modern architecture, real-time reload
   - Cons: Limited cross-browser support, single tab execution

3. TestComplete
   - Pros: Robust GUI testing, multiple scripting languages
   - Cons: Expensive, steep learning curve

4. Katalon Studio
   - Pros: Cross-platform support, built-in reporting
   - Cons: Limited parallel execution in free version

5. Playwright
   - Pros: Modern automation, cross-browser support
   - Cons: Requires coding knowledge, complex setup

### 3.4 Open Questions

1. Authentication Security
   - What level of security is required for user authentication?
   - Should we implement two-factor authentication?

2. Performance Metrics
   - What is the maximum number of parallel scenarios to support?
   - What is the acceptable response time for interactions?

3. Data Management
   - How long should user session data be retained?
   - What analytics data should be collected and stored?

4. Scaling Considerations
   - How should the system handle increased user load?
   - What are the performance requirements for concurrent users?

## 4. Success Metrics

1. Technical Metrics
   - Average response time < 200ms
   - 99.9% uptime
   - Zero data loss during parallel operations
   - Successful execution of 100 concurrent scenarios

2. User Experience Metrics
