1. As a security administrator, I want to run automated vulnerability scans using OWASP ZAP so that I can identify potential security threats in the application.
2. As a system administrator, I want to configure security headers and SSL settings so that the application is protected against common web attacks.
3. As a developer, I want to implement proper session management and authentication mechanisms so that user data remains secure.
4. As a compliance officer, I want to ensure all security measures meet industry standards so that we maintain regulatory compliance.
5. As an end user, I want my sensitive data to be protected so that I can safely use the application.
