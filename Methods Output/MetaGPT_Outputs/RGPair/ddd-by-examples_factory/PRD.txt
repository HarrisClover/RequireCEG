# Production Planning and Demand Forecasting System PRD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Information
- Project Name: production_planning_system
- Document Status: Draft
- Last Updated: 2025-04-14

### 1.2 Original Requirements
The system must facilitate manual adjustments to demand forecasts while maintaining accurate records of current and future customer needs. Key functionalities include demand adjustment management, call-off document handling, shortage monitoring, production planning, and quality assurance integration.

### 1.3 Product Goals
1. Streamline demand forecast management through flexible adjustment capabilities while maintaining data integrity
2. Optimize production planning and resource utilization through intelligent scheduling and conflict resolution
3. Enhance quality control and shortage prevention through proactive monitoring and alert systems

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Demand Management
- As a demand planner, I want to manually adjust demand forecasts for current and future dates so that I can respond to changing customer needs
- As a system administrator, I want all demand adjustments to be tracked and stored so that we maintain a complete audit trail
- As a customer service representative, I want to preserve call-off document data so that I can reference original customer requirements

### 2.2 Production Planning
- As a production manager, I want the system to automatically adjust production schedules based on demand changes so that we maintain optimal resource utilization
- As a plant supervisor, I want to see potential conflicts between adjustments and future call-offs so that I can resolve issues proactively
- As a quality assurance manager, I want to prioritize QA tasks for locked parts in stock so that we maintain product quality standards
