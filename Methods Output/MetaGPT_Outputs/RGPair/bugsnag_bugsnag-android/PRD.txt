# Error Monitoring System PRD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
This PRD outlines the specifications for a comprehensive error monitoring and crash reporting system designed to capture, process, and report various types of errors and crashes in both JVM and NDK environments.

### 1.2 Original Requirements
The system must effectively report native crashes and unhandled exceptions in both JVM and NDK code, with comprehensive payload data capture, session management, and ANR detection capabilities.

### 1.3 Product Goals
1. Provide comprehensive error tracking across JVM and NDK environments with minimal performance impact
2. Enable reliable crash data capture with detailed contextual information for effective debugging
3. Maintain data consistency and accuracy while preventing duplicate error reports

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Developer Stories
- As a developer, I want to capture native crashes in both JVM and NDK code so that I can debug platform-specific issues
