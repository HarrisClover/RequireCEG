- As a developer, I want to capture native crashes in both JVM and NDK code so that I can debug platform-specific issues.
- As a developer, I want to track ANRs in both environments so that I can identify performance bottlenecks.
- As a mobile developer, I want to add custom metadata to error reports so that I can include relevant business context.
- As a QA engineer, I want to verify error reporting in various scenarios so that I can ensure system reliability.
- As a support engineer, I want to access detailed crash reports so that I can efficiently resolve user issues.
