# AWS Services Integration System PRD

## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1 Product Definition
A comprehensive AWS services integration system that enables seamless interaction with various AWS services through standardized API calls, focusing on resource management and error handling.

### 1.2 Product Goals
1. Provide unified and consistent access to multiple AWS services through standardized APIs
2. Ensure robust error handling and informative feedback across all service integrations
3. Simplify cloud resource management through comprehensive service coverage

### 1.3 User Stories
1. As a cloud administrator, I want to list all available SNS topics and SQS queues so that I can monitor and manage messaging resources effectively.
2. As a system operator, I want to receive clear error messages when accessing non-existent resources so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.
3. As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage multiple AWS services through a single integration point so that I can streamline our infrastructure management.
4. As a developer, I want consistent response formats across different AWS services so that I can build reliable applications.
