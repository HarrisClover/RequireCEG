1. As a QA engineer, I want to run multiple sleep scenarios simultaneously so that I can verify the system's parallel execution capabilities.
2. As a developer, I want to validate that concurrent operations complete independently so that I can ensure there's no interference between parallel processes.
3. As a system architect, I want to measure the actual execution time of parallel operations so that I can verify the efficiency of the parallel processing implementation.
