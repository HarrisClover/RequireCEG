# Parallel Execution Testing System PRD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Information
- Project Name: parallel_execution_test_system
- Programming Language: JavaScript, React
- Original Requirements: Implement a system to demonstrate parallel execution capabilities through sleep operations with varying durations and repetitions.

### 1.2 Product Goals
1. Validate system's capability to handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently
2. Demonstrate predictable and consistent behavior in parallel execution scenarios
3. Provide clear verification of parallel processing through measurable time metrics

### 1.3 User Stories
1. As a QA engineer, I want to run multiple sleep scenarios simultaneously so that I can verify the system's parallel execution capabilities
2. As a developer, I want to validate that concurrent operations complete independently so that I can ensure there's no interference between parallel processes
3. As a system architect, I want to measure the actual execution time of parallel operations so that I can verify the efficiency of the parallel processing implementation

### 3.5 Acceptance Criteria
1. All scenarios must execute simultaneously
2. Total execution time must be approximately 5 seconds (±100ms)
3. Each scenario must complete within its specified duration (±50ms)
4. No interference between parallel executions
5. Accurate timing measurements for all scenarios

## 4. Open Questions
1. Should we implement cancellation of running scenarios?
2. What should be the maximum number of parallel scenarios?
3. How should we handle scenario failures?
4. What level of timing precision is required for different environments?
