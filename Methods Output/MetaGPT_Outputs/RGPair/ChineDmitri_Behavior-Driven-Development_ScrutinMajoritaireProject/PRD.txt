## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals
1. Ensure secure and accurate electronic voting with comprehensive candidate management and ballot tracking
2. Provide transparent and verifiable voting results with proper handling of multiple voting rounds
3. Maintain system integrity through robust error handling and edge case management

### 2.2 User Stories
1. As an administrator, I want to register candidates with unique identifiers so that I can maintain an organized database of participants
2. As a voter, I want to cast my vote for a registered candidate so that I can participate in the election process
3. As an administrator, I want to manage ballot states (open/closed) so that I can control the voting timeline
4. As an election official, I want to view voting results with proper calculations and tie-breaking rules so that I can determine winners accurately
5. As a system user, I want clear error messages when issues occur so that I can understand and address problems effectively
