# Geocoding Service System PRD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Information
- Project Name: ny_regional_geocoding_service
- Version: 1.0
- Last Updated: 2024-04-14

### 1.2 Original Requirements
The system shall provide accurate geocoding services for cities and counties in New York and neighboring states based on specified geographic coordinates. It must return corresponding city, county, and state information, handle various error scenarios, manage address identification priorities, meet performance requirements, handle complex addressing scenarios, and categorize response types.

### 1.3 Product Goals
1. Provide highly accurate and reliable geocoding services for the New York region with 99.9% uptime
2. Deliver fast response times (<100ms) while maintaining data accuracy and proper error handling
3. Support complex addressing scenarios and administrative boundary management with clear response categorization

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Core User Stories
1. As a real estate developer, I want to lookup precise location information based on coordinates so that I can verify property jurisdictions for development projects
2. As a delivery service dispatcher, I want to validate addresses and get standardized location data so that I can ensure accurate delivery routing
3. As a government analyst, I want to batch process location data with administrative boundary information so that I can analyze regional demographics
4. As an emergency service coordinator, I want to quickly identify the correct jurisdiction for any given coordinates so that I can dispatch appropriate emergency services

## 3. Competitive Analysis

### 3.1 Market Overview

#### Competitor Analysis:
1. Google Maps Platform
   - Pros: High accuracy, comprehensive coverage
   - Cons: Expensive, complex pricing model

2. Smarty (SmartyStreets)
   - Pros: Excellent US address validation
   - Cons: High enterprise pricing

3. Mapbox
   - Pros: Great customization options
   - Cons: Limited regional specific features

4. Geocodio
   - Pros: Cost-effective, good bulk processing
   - Cons: Less comprehensive POI database

5. HERE Maps
   - Pros: Strong enterprise features
   - Cons: Complex integration process

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

#### P0 (Must-Have)
1. Coordinate-Based Lookup
   - Must accept latitude/longitude coordinates
   - Must return city, county, and state information
   - Must validate input coordinate formats

2. Error Handling
   - Must provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
   - Must handle non-numeric inputs gracefully
   - Must return appropriate HTTP status codes

3. Location Classification
   - Must categorize responses (building, address, POI)
   - Must provide confidence scores for matches
   - Must indicate match type (exact vs. interpolated)

#### P1 (Should-Have)
1. Administrative Boundaries
   - Should handle overlapping jurisdictions
   - Should provide boundary information
   - Should support multiple administrative levels

2. Performance Optimization
   - Should handle 1000 requests per second
   - Should maintain response times under 100ms
   - Should implement appropriate caching

#### P2 (Nice-to-Have)
1. Advanced Features
   - May support batch processing
   - May provide historical address data
   - May include demographic data

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance
   - Response Time: <100ms for 95th percentile
   - Throughput: 1000+ requests/second
   - Availability: 99.9% uptime

2. Security
   - TLS 1.2 or higher encryption
   - API key authentication
   - Rate limiting implementation

3. Data Quality
   - 99.9% accuracy for exact matches
   - Daily data updates
   - Comprehensive error logging

## 5. UI Design Draft

### 5.1 API Endpoint Structure
```
POST /api/v1/geocode
GET /api/v1/reverse-geocode
GET /api/v1/batch-geocode
```

### 5.2 Sample Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "location": {
      "city": "Albany",
      "county": "Albany County",
      "state": "NY"
    },
    "coordinates": {
      "latitude": 42.6526,
      "longitude": -73.7562
    },
    "classification": {
      "type": "building",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "match_level": "exact"
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Open Questions

1. Data Updates
   - What is the frequency of administrative boundary updates?
   - How will we handle historical address changes?

2. Performance
   - Should we implement regional-specific caching strategies?
   - What are the exact peak load requirements?

3. Integration
   - How will we handle integration with existing systems?
   - What authentication methods should be supported?
