1. As a real estate developer, I want to lookup precise location information based on coordinates so that I can verify property jurisdictions for development projects.
2. As a delivery service dispatcher, I want to validate addresses and get standardized location data so that I can ensure accurate delivery routing.
3. As a government analyst, I want to batch process location data with administrative boundary information so that I can analyze regional demographics.
4. As an emergency service coordinator, I want to quickly identify the correct jurisdiction for any given coordinates so that I can dispatch appropriate emergency services.
