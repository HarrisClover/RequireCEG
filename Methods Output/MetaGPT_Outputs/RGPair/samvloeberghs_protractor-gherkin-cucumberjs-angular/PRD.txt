### 3.5 Open Questions

1. **Security Considerations**
   - What is the maximum failed login attempts before account lockout?
   - How long should password reset links remain valid?

2. **User Experience**
   - Should we implement progressive password requirements?
   - Should we allow users to see their password strength in real-time?

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - What should be the session timeout duration?
   - Should we implement refresh tokens?

4. **Compliance**
   - Do we need to implement specific regional compliance requirements?
   - What data retention policies should we implement?
