1. As a store owner, I want to create new products with detailed information so that I can expand my product catalog efficiently.
2. As a catalog manager, I want to retrieve product details using a unique ID so that I can quickly verify or update product information.
3. As a product administrator, I want to receive confirmation messages for my actions so that I can be confident the system processed my requests correctly.
