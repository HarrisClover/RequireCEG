### 2.2 User Stories
1. As a node operator, I want to easily bootstrap and synchronize my node from Local Snapshot and data databases so that I can quickly join the network
2. As a developer, I want to interact with reliable API endpoints to manage node operations and retrieve transaction information
3. As a network participant, I want to create and broadcast transactions that are properly validated and stored
4. As a system administrator, I want to maintain an efficient network by properly pruning old transactions while preserving the inclusion state
