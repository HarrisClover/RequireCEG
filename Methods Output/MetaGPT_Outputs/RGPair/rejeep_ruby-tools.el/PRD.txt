# Ruby Tools Mode PRD

## 1. Project Information
- Project Name: ruby_tools_mode
- Programming Language: Emacs Lisp
- Original Requirements: Enhance productivity for Ruby developers by providing advanced string and symbol manipulation capabilities within Emacs

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals
1. Streamline Ruby string manipulation workflows in Emacs
2. Reduce coding errors through intelligent string handling
3. Enhance developer productivity with automated Ruby-specific tools

### 2.2 User Stories
1. As a Ruby developer, I want to clear string content while preserving quotes so that I can quickly modify string contents without manual quote handling
2. As a developer working with Ruby templates, I want reliable string interpolation support so that I can efficiently work with dynamic string content
3. As a Ruby programmer, I want automatic string-symbol conversion so that I can quickly switch between different Ruby object representations
4. As a team lead, I want automatic activation of Ruby tools mode so that my team members have consistent editing capabilities

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Requirements Analysis

The Ruby Tools Mode must provide a comprehensive solution for string and symbol manipulation in Ruby development:

1. String Content Management
- Must preserve quote marks during content manipulation
- Must support both single and double quotes
- Must handle empty string conversion

2. Interpolation Handling
- Must support interpolation in double-quoted strings
- Must execute interpolation in shell commands
- Must prevent interpolation in single-quoted strings

3. Type Conversion
- Must support bidirectional string-symbol conversion
- Must preserve special characters during conversion
- Must handle cursor position appropriately

4. Integration
- Must activate automatically with Ruby mode
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing Emacs features
- Must provide consistent behavior across different Emacs versions

### 3.2 Requirements Pool

P0 (Must Have):
- Preserve quote marks during string content clearing
- Support string interpolation in double-quoted strings
- Prevent interpolation in single-quoted strings
- Convert between single and double-quoted strings
- Transform strings to symbols and vice versa
- Handle empty string conversion
- Automatic activation with Ruby mode

P1 (Should Have):
- Keyboard shortcuts for all operations
- Visual indicators for string type
- Command history for string operations
- Undo/redo support for all operations

P2 (Nice to Have):
- Custom string manipulation templates
- Batch string conversion operations
- Integration with project-wide refactoring
- String operation statistics

### 3.3 UI Design Draft

```
Ruby Tools Mode Interface:

Status Line:
[Ruby Tools: Active] ["" -> ''] [str <-> sym]

Context Menu:
- Clear String Content (Ctrl+C S)
- Toggle Quotes (Ctrl+C Q)
- Convert to Symbol (Ctrl+C Y)
- Convert to String (Ctrl+C T)

Minibuffer:
- Shows current operation
- Displays conversion preview
```

### 3.4 Open Questions

1. Feature Scope:
- Should we support additional string manipulation operations?
- What level of customization should be provided for key bindings?

2. Performance Considerations:
- How to handle large files with many string operations?
- What is the performance impact of automatic mode activation?

3. Integration Concerns:
- How to handle conflicts with other Ruby-related modes?
- What level of version compatibility should be maintained?

4. User Experience:
- Should we provide visual feedback for string types?
- How to handle error cases and provide meaningful messages?

## 4. Success Metrics

1. Adoption Metrics:
- Installation rate among Emacs Ruby developers
- Active usage in Ruby projects

2. Performance Metrics:
- Response time for string operations (<100ms)
- Memory overhead (<5MB)

3. User Satisfaction:
- GitHub stars and forks
- Positive feedback ratio
- Bug report frequency

## 5. Timeline
