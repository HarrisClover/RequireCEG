1. As a Ruby developer, I want to clear string content while preserving quotes so that I can quickly modify string contents without manual quote handling.
2. As a developer working with Ruby templates, I want reliable string interpolation support so that I can efficiently work with dynamic string content.
3. As a Ruby programmer, I want automatic string-symbol conversion so that I can quickly switch between different Ruby object representations.
4. As a team lead, I want automatic activation of Ruby tools mode so that my team members have consistent editing capabilities.
