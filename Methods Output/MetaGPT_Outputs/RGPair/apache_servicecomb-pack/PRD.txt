# Alpha System - Transaction Management System PRD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Original Requirements
The Alpha system is required to accurately record transaction events for various services (Car, Hotel, and Booking Services) while ensuring proper transaction management and compensation handling for failures.

### 1.2 Product Goals
- Establish a reliable distributed transaction management system with comprehensive event logging
- Ensure data consistency across multiple services through saga pattern implementation
- Provide robust error handling and compensation mechanisms for failed transactions

### 1.3 User Stories
- As a user (Sean), I want to book cars and hotel rooms in a single transaction so that my travel arrangements are coordinated
- As a system administrator, I want to track the complete lifecycle of transactions so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues
- As a service provider, I want failed transactions to be properly compensated so that my inventory remains accurate

### 3.5 Data Models

#### Transaction Record
```json
{
  "transactionId": "string",
  "status": "enum(STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED)",
  "services": ["CAR", "HOTEL"],
  "startTime": "timestamp",
  "endTime": "timestamp",
  "events": ["Event[]"],
  "compensation": "CompensationStatus"
}
```

#### Service Order
```json
{
  "orderId": "string",
  "serviceType": "enum(CAR, HOTEL)",
  "units": "integer",
  "status": "enum(CONFIRMED, CANCELLED)",
  "compensated": "boolean"
}
```

## 4. Open Questions

1. **Timeout Configuration**
   - What are the appropriate timeout values for different services?
   - How should timeout values be configured per service type?

2. **Compensation Strategy**
   - Should partial compensations be allowed?
   - What is the retry strategy for failed compensations?

3. **Monitoring Requirements**
   - What are the key metrics for system health?
   - What alerting thresholds should be set?

## 5. Success Metrics

1. **Reliability**
   - Transaction success rate > 99.9%
   - Compensation success rate > 99.99%
   - Zero data inconsistencies

2. **Performance**
   - Transaction completion < 5s
   - Compensation execution < 3s
   - Event logging latency < 100ms

3. **Scalability**
   - Support 1000 concurrent transactions
   - Handle 10000 events per second
   - Maintain performance under load
