- As a user (Sean), I want to book cars and hotel rooms in a single transaction so that my travel arrangements are coordinated.
- As a system administrator, I want to track the complete lifecycle of transactions so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues.
- As a service provider, I want failed transactions to be properly compensated so that my inventory remains accurate.
