1. As a GIS administrator, I want to initialize new GeoGig repositories via API calls so that I can automate the creation process.
2. As a system integrator, I want to receive clear error messages and appropriate status codes so that I can properly handle error scenarios in my application.
3. As a data manager, I want to import existing repositories with proper validation so that I can migrate data safely.
4. As a developer, I want to receive responses in both JSON and XML formats so that I can integrate with different client applications.
