# Test Page System PRD

## 1. Project Information
- Project Name: selenium_test_page
- Programming Stack: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- Original Requirements: Create a web test page system with name input validation, Selenium test capabilities across different web drivers, data-driven testing support, and definition lookup functionality.

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals
1. Create a reliable testing environment for web applications using Selenium across multiple web drivers
2. Provide comprehensive name input validation with various test scenarios
3. Enable efficient data-driven testing and term definition lookup capabilities

### 2.2 User Stories
1. As a QA engineer, I want to run tests across different web drivers so that I can ensure cross-browser compatibility
2. As a test automation engineer, I want to use CSV files for data-driven testing so that I can efficiently test multiple test cases
3. As a developer, I want to validate name input fields so that I can ensure data quality
4. As a user, I want to look up definitions of terms so that I can understand their meanings

### 2.3 Competitive Analysis

#### Existing Solutions:
1. Selenium WebDriver Test Page
   - Pros: Wide browser support, extensive documentation
   - Cons: Limited built-in validation features, no definition lookup

2. TestCafe Demo Page
   - Pros: Modern architecture, easy setup
   - Cons: Limited to specific browsers, no data-driven testing support

3. Cypress Test Page
   - Pros: Real-time reload, great debugging
   - Cons: Limited cross-browser testing, no term lookup

4. Playwright Test Environment
   - Pros: Fast execution, built-in async support
   - Cons: Newer platform, less community support

5. WebdriverIO Test Page
   - Pros: Good automation features
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve, complex setup

### 3.4 Open Questions
1. What are the specific validation rules for name fields?
2. Should we support additional web drivers beyond HtmlUnit and PhantomJS?
3. What is the expected format for CSV test data files?
4. How should we handle definition lookup failures?
5. What performance metrics should we track and report?
