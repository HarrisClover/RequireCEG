1. As a test engineer, I want to create navigation tests using both single and multi-class step definitions so that I can organize my test code effectively.
2. As a QA developer, I want proper WebDriver management with Before and After hooks so that browser instances are handled correctly.
3. As an automation tester, I want seamless page transitions with wait hooks so that my tests are stable and reliable.
4. As a test framework user, I want to share state between test steps so that I can maintain test context throughout the execution.
