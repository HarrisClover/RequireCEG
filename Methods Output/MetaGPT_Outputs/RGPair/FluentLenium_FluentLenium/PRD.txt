# Navigation Test System PRD

## 1. Project Information
- Project Name: navigation_test_system
- Programming Language: Java 8, Cucumber
- Original Requirements: Implementation of a web application testing framework with multi-page navigation support, utilizing Cucumber with Java 8 for test automation, incorporating both single and multi-class step definitions, wait hooks, and proper WebDriver management.

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals
1. Enable robust automated testing of web application navigation flows
2. Provide a flexible and maintainable test framework architecture
3. Ensure consistent and reliable test execution across features

### 2.2 User Stories
1. As a test engineer, I want to create navigation tests using both single and multi-class step definitions so that I can organize my test code effectively
2. As a QA developer, I want proper WebDriver management with Before and After hooks so that browser instances are handled correctly
3. As an automation tester, I want seamless page transitions with wait hooks so that my tests are stable and reliable
4. As a test framework user, I want to share state between test steps so that I can maintain test context throughout the execution

### 2.3 Competitive Analysis

#### Existing Solutions:
1. Selenium TestNG Framework
   - Pros: Mature ecosystem, extensive documentation
   - Cons: No native support for BDD, complex setup required

2. JBehave
   - Pros: BDD-focused, good Java integration
   - Cons: Limited community support, steep learning curve

3. Serenity BDD
   - Pros: Built-in reporting, extensive features
   - Cons: Heavy framework, can be overwhelming for simple projects

4. Karate Framework
   - Pros: All-in-one solution, API testing capabilities
   - Cons: Limited web UI testing features, different syntax learning required

5. Robot Framework
   - Pros: Keyword-driven testing, extensive libraries
   - Cons: Python-based, requires additional setup for Java integration

### 3.3 UI Design Draft

#### Main Page Structure
```text
+------------------------+
|      Header Area       |
+------------------------+
|                        |
|    Content Section     |
|                        |
+------------------------+
|   Navigation Control   |
| [Prev] [1][2][3] [Next]
+------------------------+
```

#### Navigation Controls
```text
Button States:
- Next: Enabled when not on last page
- Previous: Enabled when not on first page
- Page Numbers: Highlighted for current page
```

### 3.4 Open Questions

1. WebDriver Configuration
   - What is the default timeout for page transitions?
   - Should we support multiple browser types?
   - How to handle driver capabilities configuration?

2. State Management
   - What is the scope of shared state?
   - How to handle cleanup of shared resources?
   - Should we implement state isolation between features?

3. Test Organization
   - What is the recommended structure for step definition classes?
   - How to handle common steps across features?
   - What naming conventions should be followed?

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 WebDriver Management
```java
@Before
public void setUp() {
    // Initialize WebDriver
    driver = null;  // Initial state
    // Setup based on configuration
}

@After
public void tearDown() {
    // Cleanup WebDriver
    if (driver != null) {
        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Navigation Implementation
```java
public class NavigationSteps {
    @When("user clicks on next page")
    public void clickNextPage() {
        // Implementation
        waitForElement(nextButton);
        nextButton.click();
        waitForPageLoad();
    }
}
```
