# Collective Taxi Reservation System PRD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Information
- **Project Name**: collective_taxi_system
- **Programming Language**: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Version**: 1.0

### 1.2 Original Requirements
The system shall provide a login and registration feature that allows users to access their existing accounts or create new ones to make reservations for collective taxis. Users must be able to log in successfully with valid credentials and receive appropriate error messages when login attempts with invalid data are made. The registration process must allow users to fill in their personal details, and the system shall validate the input to ensure that invalid data is correctly handled with corresponding feedback. Upon successful registration, users should be redirected to the login page with a success message displayed. Furthermore, logged-in users shall have the ability to make reservations for shared taxi rides, with real-time updates on ticket prices based on the number of passengers and specified time periods. The system must ensure that reservations are not possible during times with no available offers. Additionally, the application should handle scenarios where users attempt to reserve rides with JavaScript disabled, providing appropriate messages and fallbacks. The solution must be robust enough to maintain distinct user sessions across different test environments, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of session states or potential application errors.

### 1.3 Product Goals
1. Create a secure and user-friendly authentication system for collective taxi reservations
2. Implement a reliable real-time pricing and booking system for shared rides
3. Ensure system robustness across different environments and scenarios

## 2. User Stories

1. As a new user, I want to create an account with my personal details so that I can start booking shared taxi rides
2. As a registered user, I want to log in securely to access my account and make reservations
3. As a customer, I want to see real-time pricing updates based on passenger count and time periods so that I can make informed booking decisions
4. As a user with JavaScript disabled, I want to still be able to use basic system features so that I can make reservations
5. As a frequent user, I want my session to remain secure and consistent across different environments so that I can trust the system with my bookings
