# Product Requirements Document: Web Automation Testing Suite

## 1. Project Information
- **Project Name**: web_automation_test_suite
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript with Selenium WebDriver
- **Original Requirements**: Develop a web automation testing suite that handles login flows for Homerunner platform, Gmail authentication, and Wikipedia search functionality.

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals
1. Streamline web automation testing processes across multiple platforms
2. Ensure reliable and consistent user authentication workflows
3. Provide seamless cross-platform testing capabilities

### 2.2 User Stories
1. As a QA engineer, I want to automate the Homerunner platform login flow so that I can verify the form submission process works correctly.
2. As a test automation engineer, I want to validate Gmail login/logout functionality so that I can ensure the authentication process is working as expected.
3. As a QA tester, I want to automate Wikipedia search functionality so that I can verify the search process for non-logged-in users.

### 2.3 Competitive Analysis

#### Popular Web Automation Tools:

1. **Selenium WebDriver**
   - Pros: Wide language support, large community, free
   - Cons: Setup complexity, slower execution

2. **Cypress**
   - Pros: Modern architecture, great debugging
   - Cons: Limited cross-browser support

3. **Playwright**
   - Pros: Fast execution, cross-browser support
   - Cons: Newer tool, smaller community

4. **TestCafe**
   - Pros: No setup required, cross-browser testing
   - Cons: Limited plugin ecosystem

5. **Puppeteer**
   - Pros: Chrome DevTools Protocol integration
   - Cons: Limited to Chromium-based browsers
