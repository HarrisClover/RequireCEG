# REST Mock Service - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Information
- **Project Name**: rest_mock_service
- **Document Status**: Draft
- **Programming Language**: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Original Requirements**: Create a REST Mock service application supporting both REST and SOAP services with SEQUENCE and SCRIPT-based response dispatching, including CRUD operations, parameter synchronization, OAuth 2.0 integration, and comprehensive management features.

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals
1. Provide a robust and flexible mock service platform supporting both REST and SOAP protocols
2. Streamline the testing process through automated response management and parameter synchronization
3. Ensure secure and efficient API testing with comprehensive OAuth 2.0 integration

### 2.2 User Stories
1. As a QA engineer, I want to create mock services that can return different responses in sequence so that I can test various scenarios without changing the mock configuration.
2. As an API developer, I want to manage OAuth 2.0 tokens automatically so that I can focus on testing endpoints without manually refreshing expired tokens.
3. As a test automation engineer, I want to create script-based response logic so that I can simulate complex backend behaviors.
4. As a SOAP service tester, I want to manage SOAP mock services similarly to REST services so that I can maintain consistency in testing approaches.
