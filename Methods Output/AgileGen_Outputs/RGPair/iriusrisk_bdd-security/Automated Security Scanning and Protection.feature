Feature: Automated Security Scanning and Protection
  As a security officer,
  I want to implement automated application security scanning and enforce security measures
  So that the system can be protected against common vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

Scenario: Conduct automated application security scanning with OWASP ZAP
  Given the system has implemented OWASP ZAP for automated security scanning
  And the scanning policies are set to high attack strength with low alert thresholds
  When a security scan is conducted
  Then the system should identify and report all vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, and remote file inclusion
  And no medium or higher risk vulnerabilities should be present

Scenario: Enforce security headers to protect against attacks
  Given the system must include proper HTTP headers
  When a response is sent by the server
  Then the response should contain the headers "X-Frame-Options", "X-XSS-Protection", and "Strict-Transport-Security"
  And these headers should protect against clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks

Scenario: Validate session management controls
  Given the user has logged into the system
  When the user logs out or becomes inactive
  Then the session ID should be invalidated
  And the session cookies should have the "secure" and "httpOnly" flags set

Scenario: Ensure strong SSL configuration and encryption
  Given the system uses SSL for secure communication
  When a connection is established
  Then the system should disable weak protocols
  And it should support strong TLS versions and ciphers
  And perfect forward secrecy should be enabled

Scenario: Validate CORS policy for cross-origin requests
  Given the system implements a CORS policy
  When a cross-origin request is made
  Then the system should validate the request and restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data

Scenario: Enforce data confidentiality and secure transmission
  Given the system handles sensitive data
  When data is transmitted
  Then the system should prevent browser caching of sensitive data
  And ensure the data is transmitted securely over HTTPS

Scenario: Implement secure user authentication mechanisms
  Given the system enforces strong user authentication
  When a user provides their credentials
  Then the system should require case-sensitive passwords
  And ensure the password is transmitted securely over HTTPS
