Feature: User Account Management and System Functionality
  As a system administrator,
  I want to manage user accounts, ensure the system operates smoothly, and support various functionalities
  So that users can have a seamless experience interacting with the system

Scenario: Managing User Accounts and Credit Transactions
  Given that the system allows credit transactions
  And the user has an account with a balance of $500
  When a user adds $100 to their balance
  Then the user's account balance should be $600
  And the system should record the transaction accurately

Scenario: Health Check API
  Given the system is running
  When a health check API request is made
  Then the API should return a 200 status code
  And the response body should not be empty

Scenario: Generating Random Numbers
  Given the system allows random number generation
  When a user specifies a range between 1 and 100
  Then the system should return a random number within the specified range

Scenario: Uploading and Retrieving Project Data via RESTful API
  Given the user has a valid project data file
  When the user uploads the project data via the RESTful API
  Then the API should return a successful response
  And the user should be able to retrieve the uploaded project data

Scenario: Performing Addition on Integers
  Given the system has a calculator feature
  When the user performs the addition of 3 and 5
  Then the system should return 8 as the result

Scenario: Searching for Books in a Bookstore
  Given the system allows users to search for books by title or author
  When the user searches for a book titled "The Great Gatsby"
  Then the system should return the correct book information
  And if the book does not exist, the system should indicate that no results were found

Scenario: Handling API Endpoint Responses
  Given that the system has a set of API endpoints
  When the user makes an API request
  Then the system should return the correct status code
  And the API should match the expected payload as defined

Scenario: Retrieving System Version and Server Responses
  Given the system has a version endpoint
  When a user requests the version information
  Then the system should return the correct version number and server response
