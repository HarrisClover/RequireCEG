Feature: User Interaction and Drag-and-Drop Operations
As a user,
I want to interact with the system through a series of button clicks and drag-and-drop actions
So that I can perform various actions within the application seamlessly

Scenario Outline: Simulate Button Clicks and Drag-and-Drop Actions
Given a user is logged into the system
When the user clicks on the specified numbers <num1> and <num2>
Then the system should recognize the click combination <num1> and <num2>
And a delay of 1 second should occur before the next operation
And the user can drag and drop items after the click actions
And the drag-and-drop operation should be executed correctly
And the system should process multiple scenarios in parallel without interference

Examples:
| num1 | num2 |
| 4    | 3    |
| 1    | 2    |
| 5    | 6    |
| 7    | 8    |
