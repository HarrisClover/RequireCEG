Feature: Automated Security Scanning and Protection Measures
  As a security engineer,
  I want to ensure that the application is secure from various vulnerabilities and leaks
  So that sensitive data is protected, and vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated.

  Scenario: Automated Security Scanning with OWASP ZAP
    Given that the system has configured OWASP ZAP for automated security scanning
    And the scanning policies are set to high attack strength and low alert thresholds
    When the system is scanned for vulnerabilities
    Then the scan should identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, and others
    And no medium or higher risk vulnerabilities should be present.

  Scenario: Enforcing Secure HTTP Headers
    Given that the system is configured to use security headers
    When a user accesses the application
    Then the response should include X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Strict-Transport-Security headers
    And these headers should be set to protect against clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks.

  Scenario: Session Management Controls
    Given that the system enforces session management controls
    When a user logs out or after a period of inactivity
    Then the session ID should be invalidated
    And the session cookies should have security flags such as 'secure' and 'httpOnly'.

  Scenario: Secure SSL Configuration
    Given that the system is configured with strong SSL settings
    When a user accesses the application over HTTPS
    Then weak SSL protocols and ciphers should be disabled
    And the system should support strong TLS versions and ciphers while enabling perfect forward secrecy.

  Scenario: CORS Validation
    Given that the system enforces CORS policies
    When a cross-origin request is made
    Then the system should validate the request based on user authorization levels
    And reject unauthorized access to sensitive data.

  Scenario: Preventing Caching of Sensitive Data
    Given that the system handles sensitive data
    When sensitive data is transmitted
    Then the browser should not cache sensitive data
    And the system should ensure secure transmission of this data.

  Scenario: Robust User Authentication
    Given that the system enforces strong user authentication
    When a user creates or logs in to their account
    Then the system should require case-sensitive passwords
    And ensure that authentication is performed over HTTPS.
