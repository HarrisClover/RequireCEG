Feature: Validate Navigation Documents Structure

  As a digital publication validator
  I want to ensure the submitted Navigation Document complies with EPUB specifications
  So that the submitted documents are properly structured, accessible, and free of errors

  Background:
    Given a Navigation Document is submitted for validation
    And validation criteria are defined according to EPUB specifications

  Scenario: Check Required Elements
    Given the Navigation Document is missing required elements
    When validating the document
    Then the system should log an error message indicating the missing elements

  Scenario: Verify Data Types
    Given the Navigation Document contains elements with incorrect data types
    When the system checks data types of required elements
    Then the system should report an error specifying the element and the expected data type

  Scenario: Analyze Structure for Nesting Violations
    Given the structure of the Navigation Document has nesting violations
    When the system analyzes the structural hierarchy
    Then the system should provide detailed feedback on specific structural issues

  Scenario: Identify Duplicate Identifiers
    Given the Navigation Document contains duplicate identifiers
    When the system assesses identifiers for redundancy
    Then the system should issue warnings about the detected anomalies

  Scenario: Validate URLs for Compliance
    Given the Navigation Document has non-conforming URLs
    When the URLs are validated for compliance
    Then the system should trigger appropriate warnings for non-compliant URLs

  Scenario: Check Accessibility Features
    Given the Navigation Document lacks necessary accessibility features
    When the system assesses accessibility compliance
    Then the system should log significant compliance errors for missing accessibility features

  Scenario: Structure Adherence Check
    Given the structure of the Navigation Document does not adhere to the expected nesting requirements
    When the system verifies the structure of the Navigation Document
    Then the system should provide detailed feedback outlining specific structural issues

  Scenario: Unique Identifiers Verification
    Given the Navigation Document has non-unique identifiers
    When the system checks for identifier uniqueness
    Then the system should issue warnings when duplicate identifiers are detected

  Scenario: Real-Time Accessibility Compliance
    Given the Navigation Document does not contain necessary accessibility features
    When the system evaluates accessibility adherence
    Then the system should log significant compliance errors for missing features

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Validate Navigation Document
    Given the Navigation Document contains <element>
    And it has a <data-type> <element-name>
    When the validation process is executed
    Then the validation report shows <outcome>
    Examples:
      | element | data-type | element-name | outcome |
      | navLabel | string | mainLabel | passes validation |
      | navTarget | string | resourceLink | fails due to missing |
      | navLabel | number | secondaryLabel | fails due to type error |
