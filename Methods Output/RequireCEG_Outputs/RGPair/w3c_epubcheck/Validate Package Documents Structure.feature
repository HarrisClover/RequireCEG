Feature: Validate Package Documents Structure

  As a document author
  I want to ensure that my Package Document complies with EPUB standards
  So that I can avoid errors and ensure accessibility across platforms

  Background:
    Given the Package Document is prepared for validation
    And the required elements and structural rules are known

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Missing Required Elements
    Given the Package Document lacks essential elements
    When the document is analyzed by EPUBCheck
    Then an error message identifying the absent elements should be issued
    And the user should be informed of what is missing

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Invalid Data Types
    Given the Package Document contains elements with incorrect data types
    When the document is validated by EPUBCheck
    Then an error flag should notify of specific invalid data types

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Structural Validation
    Given the Package Document structure is examined
    When the document is validated
    Then feedback detailing structural issues identified should be provided

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Duplicate Identifiers
    Given the Package Document contains duplicate identifiers
    When EPUBCheck processes the document
    Then an error report should flag the duplicates

  Scenario: Scenario 5: URL Format Compliance
    Given the Package Document includes URLs
    When the URLs are checked for conformity
    Then a non-conformance issue alert should be generated for any incorrect formats

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Metadata Property Validation
    Given the metadata properties of the Package Document are examined
    When misuse of essential identifiers is detected
    Then the user should receive a notification and suggestions for adjustments

    Given the Package Document contains obsolete attributes or elements
    When the document is validated
    Then a warning should be issued for necessary updates

  Scenario: Scenario 8: Remote Resource Validation
    Given the Package Document cites remote resources
    When the resources are validated for media types
    Then compliance should be confirmed across various platforms

  Scenario: Scenario 9: Incorrect URL Format
    Given the Package Document contains URLs that do not conform to the expected format
    When the document is validated by EPUBCheck
    Then a non-conformance issue alert should be generated for incorrect URLs

  Scenario: Scenario 10: Misuse of Essential Identifiers
    Given the metadata properties distract from essential identifiers
    When the document is validated
    Then the user should be informed with suggestions for proper usage
