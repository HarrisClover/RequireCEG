Feature: Generate Comprehensive Error Reports

  As a system administrator
  I want to validate package, content, and navigation documents for compliance and correctness
  So that I can ensure data integrity and compliance across all platforms

  Background:
    Given documents are prepared for analysis
    And the system is ready to process the documents

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Missing Required Elements
    Given an uploaded package document
    When the system analyzes the document
    Then it should identify missing required elements
    And the report should specify which elements are absent

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Invalid Data Types
    Given a content document with fields
    When the system validates the field data types
    Then it should flag the fields with invalid data types
    And the report should list the incorrect fields

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Duplicate Identifiers Detected
    Given a navigation document that contains identifiers
    When the system checks for duplicates
    Then it should generate a report of conflicting identifiers

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Invalid URLs
    Given a set of URLs in the documents
    When the system validates the URLs against specified formats
    Then it should issue an error report for invalid URLs
    And highlight the discrepancies

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Missing Critical Identifiers
    Given dictionaries and glossaries without 'dc:type'
    When the system checks for essential identifiers
    Then it should raise a critical error
    And report the absence of 'dc:type'

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Remote Resource Handling Issues
    Given remote resources included in documents
    When the system processes the remote resources
    Then it should produce a warning related to verification
    And provide guidance on handling the remote resources

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Validate Attributes
    Given a document with attributes that should be checked of type <attribute-type>
    When the system checks the attributes for <reason>
    Then it should provide a warning for <warning-type>
    Examples:
      | attribute-type | reason | warning-type |
      | media overlays | improper usage | incorrectly assigned media type |
      | accessibility attributes | misuse | misapplied properties |
      | deprecated elements | outdated practices | usage warning |
