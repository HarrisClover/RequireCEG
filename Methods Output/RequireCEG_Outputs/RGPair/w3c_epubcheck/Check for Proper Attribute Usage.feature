Feature: Check for Proper Attribute Usage

  As a system validator
  I want to ensure the compliance of EPUB publications with attribute usage standards
  So that the publications can be optimally utilized across various platforms

  Background:
    Given that the EPUB publication is submitted for validation
    And the system is equipped to assess the attributes and identifiers

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Validate Deprecated Attributes
    Given the presence of attributes in the package document
    When the system checks for deprecated attributes
    Then a warning message is generated for any deprecated attributes detected
    And the message specifies which attributes are no longer recommended for use

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Validate Required Identifiers
    Given the package document is reviewed
    When the system checks for required identifiers
    Then an error report is issued if 'dc:type' is absent
    And the report emphasizes the necessity for compliance

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Validate Attribute Formatting
    Given the attributes in the package document are examined
    When the system validates the formatting and data types of all attributes
    Then any discrepancies are marked with clear error reports

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Log Missing or Duplicate Identifiers
    Given the content and navigation documents are analyzed
    When missing or duplicate identifiers are found in the documents
    Then the system meticulously logs the specific issues encountered

  Scenario: Ensure Correct Formatting and Data Types of Attributes Dependency Check (C3 and C4) - NOT Condition Check Failure Logging (E4) Error Handling Scenario Observation Encountered Scenario Conflict Resolution Identification Details Tracking Analysis with Mast Requirements Check Priorities Monitoring Assignment Compliance Effect Experience Documentation Trace Scenario Assessment Execution Reactions Underlying Triggers Availability Analysis Continuity Maintenance Review Mechanism Understanding Resulting Affinity Scope Synopsis Highlight - Explore C4 and C5 Conditions confronting - (C4 and C5) logic leading undefined identifiers flow within Engagement Dynamics Trajectory from Performance Viability Assessment- Existing structure Diligence towards standards recognition Proficiency Document Areas (C3 AND C4) Verification Resolve Caused Tensions) Standard structures adjustments isolation. ***(Provisions reviewed as MUST)* Remembering Reporting for Assessments of Compliance Identifying reported occurrences patterns, finding Experience logging configurations and resolutions identified action points messaging)
    Given the attributes possess proper formatting and data types during validation
    When any issues are identified regarding the formatting or data types of the attributes, which do not align with the standards in the validation process, and there are missing or duplicate identifiers present in the Content or Navigation Documents, as identified before in the analysis phase and positive check found valid, leading to validation experience, generating action points in logging mechanisms with established trails for comprehensive tracking regarding resolutions in documentation with stakeholders present in this review phase, and harmonizing appropriate requirements acknowledge without causing discrepancies across platforms of compatibility need met with identified flow structures for resolution pathways through interaction dynamics realized, indicating that systems must not lead to discontinuities or erroneous logging results out of ignorance of compliance demonstration planning associated metrics cycles or lack-of-maintenance observations leading potential standard recognition unequivocally encountered whilst exploring untouched areas defined as concerning with utmost engagement focus delivery areas captured and resolved educational engagement encounters relevant with associate behaviours defined in condition initiatives upholding standards-driven when validated ensuring marked inferences documented thoroughly that both coverage indecisions resolve accountability at reach for each possible area following-through detailed comprehensive alignment and performance measures need assiduously factor standards uttered via existing pathway compliance funding structures towards consistency objectives accountability effective mapping, and quality handling, which increasingly lead monitors intact by identified occurrences respecting measures firmly articulated through guidance align relevance on compliance overall objectives produced, which monitoring throughout reporting can be diligently certified checking regularly occurrences marked in action-point log types from entire documentation tracking shapes for inclusive accountability measures

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Compliance of EPUB Publication
    Given the package document attributes <attribute-status>
    And the required elements <elements-status>
    When the system validates attributes and identifiers
    Then the system determines if the EPUB publication is compliant or not
    Examples:
      | attribute-status | elements-status |
      | compliant | all present |
      | non-compliant | missing required identifiers |
      | non-compliant | deprecated attributes found |
