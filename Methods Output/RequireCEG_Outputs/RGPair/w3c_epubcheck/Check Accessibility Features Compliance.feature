Feature: Check Accessibility Features Compliance

  As a content publisher
  I want to ensure that all required accessibility elements are present and correctly implemented
  So that my publication is compliant with accessibility standards and usable by all readers

  Background:
    Given the EPUB publication is flagged as having accessibility features
    And the document format matches recognized EPUB formats

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Verify presence of required accessibility elements
    Given the publication contains accessibility features
    When the system checks for required elements like 'alt texts', 'table of contents', and 'media overlays'
    Then the system should detect any missing elements
    And an error message specifying which element is missing should be displayed

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Validate media overlays alignment
    Given the publication includes media overlays
    When the system checks alignment of each overlay with the corresponding text content
    Then the system should identify any discrepancies in alignment
    And an error message detailing the mismatch should be generated

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Check accessibility metadata compliance
    Given the publication contains metadata properties related to accessibility
    When the system verifies 'role' and 'label' attributes for compliance with EPUB standards
    Then the system should identify any malformed metadata attributes
    And a warning message offering suggestions for correction should be issued

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Validate media overlays presence
    Given the publication includes media overlays
    When the system checks for the presence of media overlays
    Then the system should confirm media overlays are present

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Validate accessibility of metadata
    Given the publication contains metadata properties related to accessibility
    When the system checks metadata for compliance with EPUB standards
    Then the system should confirm the metadata properties adhere to accessibility best practices
    And a warning message should be generated if discrepancies are found

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Validate remote resources for accessibility
    Given the publication references remote resources for accessibility functions
    And the system checks the accessibility of these resources
    When the system validates compliance with specified media types
    Then the system should confirm the accessibility of all referenced resources
    Examples:
      | Resource Type | Compliance Status | Media Type | Outcome |
      | Image | Compliant | image/png | No issues detected |
      | Audio | Non-Compliant | audio/mpeg | Accessibility issues found |
      | Document | Compliant | application/pdf | No issues detected |
      | Video | Non-Compliant | video/mp4 | Accessibility issues found |
