Feature: Validate Content Documents Structure

  As a content document validator
  I want to ensure that the Content Document adheres to structural and validation rules
  So that the content meets compliance standards and is free from errors

  Background:
    Given the Content Document has been created
    And all necessary elements are included for validation

  Scenario: Missing Required Elements
    Given the Content Document is missing necessary elements
    When the validation tool checks for required elements
    Then an error message explicitly stating which required elements are absent is generated

  Scenario: Incorrect Data Types
    Given the Content Document contains elements with incorrect data types
    When the validation tool checks for data types
    Then an error detailing the specific data type issues present is reported

  Scenario: Structural Violations Detected
    Given the Content Document does not adhere to structural rules
    When the validation tool checks document structure
    Then an error message outlining the specific structural violations detected is displayed

  Scenario: Missing or Duplicated Identifiers
    Given identifiers in the Content Document are missing or duplicated
    When the validation tool checks for identifiers
    Then the errors for missing or duplicated identifiers are highlighted for user correction

  Scenario: Non-conforming URLs
    Given the Content Document contains non-conforming URLs
    When the validation tool checks the URLs
    Then the tool raises an error that includes a list of problematic URLs

  Scenario: Improper Attributes Found
    Given the Content Document has improper attributes
    When the validation tool checks for attributes
    Then a notification informs the user of the invalid attributes being used

  Scenario: Media Overlays and Accessibility Features
    Given media overlays and accessibility features are not correctly utilized
    When the validation tool checks for these features
    Then a warning is generated regarding the improper utilization of media overlays and accessibility features and provides guidance

  Scenario: Metadata Properties Implementation
    Given metadata properties like 'dc:type' are incorrectly implemented
    When the validation tool checks metadata properties
    Then a detailed error message for necessary corrections regarding 'dc:type' property is delivered

  Scenario: Remote Resources Validation
    Given the Content Document references remote resources
    When the validation tool checks for media type correspondence
    Then errors for mismatches of referenced remote resources and appropriate media types are raised

  Scenario: Deprecated Attributes Detected
    Given the Content Document contains deprecated attributes or elements
    When the validation tool scans for deprecated elements
    Then a warning is issued if any deprecated attributes or elements are detected

  Scenario: Not using Media Overlays when Required
    Given the Content Document has valid content but it lacks correctly utilized media overlays
    When the validation tool checks for media overlays
    Then a warning is generated indicating required media overlays are missing

  Scenario: Invalid Combination of Conditions
    Given the Content Document has improperly utilized media overlays and accessibility features
    And it also contains deprecated attributes or elements
    When the validation tool runs validation checks
    Then both warnings regarding the improper utilization and deprecation issues should be raised
