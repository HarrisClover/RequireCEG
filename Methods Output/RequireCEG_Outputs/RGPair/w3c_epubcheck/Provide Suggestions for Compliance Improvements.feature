Feature: Provide Suggestions for Compliance Improvements

  As a user of the EPUBCheck tool
  I want to receive suggestions for compliance improvements
  So that my documents adhere to the latest standards and improve usability

  Background:
    Given the user is validating a document
    And the document may have compliance issues

  Scenario: Missing Required Elements in Package Document
    Given the EPUBCheck tool detects a missing required element
    When the user reviews the validation results
    Then a suggestion should be generated to remind the user to add the specified element
    And the user receives a notification about the missing element

  Scenario: Duplicate Identifiers Found
    Given the tool identifies duplicate identifiers within a document
    When the user checks the validation report
    Then the tool should provide a recommendation to consolidate duplicate identifiers

  Scenario: Non-Conforming Data Types
    Given the tool finds data types that do not conform to required types
    When the user examines the discrepancies
    Then the tool shall prompt the user to adjust the data types accordingly

  Scenario: Invalid URLs Detection
    Given non-conforming URLs are found in the document
    When the user views the validation summary
    Then the tool must issue a prompt for the user to verify and correct the links

  Scenario: Misconfigured Accessibility Features
    Given the tool discovers misconfigured necessary attributes in accessibility features
    When the user inspects the accessibility compliance
    Then the tool should provide specific recommendations for correcting misconfigured attributes

  Scenario: Detection of Deprecated Attributes
    Given the tool identifies deprecated attributes or elements
    When the user analyzes the validation outcome
    Then the tool should advise the user to update their submissions
    And offer references to legacy specifications for contextual understanding

  Scenario: Mutual Exclusion of Accessibility Issues
    Given the tool detects both missing elements and duplicated identifiers in the same document
    When the user reviews the validation report
    Then the user should not observe both issues being flagged simultaneously

  Scenario: Required Dependencies on Accessibility Attributes
    Given the tool detects misconfigured accessibility attributes and a missing required element
    When the user examines the validation results
    Then the tool must indicate that these issues are interdependent and advise the user on both corrections

  Scenario: Advice on Deprecated Attributes and Accessibility Features
    Given the tool identifies deprecated attributes
    When the user reviews the accessibility features
    Then the tool must not suggest deprecated attributes in conjunction with standard accessibility features
