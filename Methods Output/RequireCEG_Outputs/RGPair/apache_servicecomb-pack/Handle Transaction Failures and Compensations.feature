Feature: Handle Transaction Failures and Compensations

  As a system administrator
  I want to manage transaction failures and implement compensation mechanisms
  So that users can have a reliable experience with booking transactions

  Background:
    Given a user has initiated a transaction to book a service
    And the system is operational and capable of logging events

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Successful Transaction
    Given a user logs in and selects a car for booking
    And the chosen car is available
    When the user submits the booking request
    Then a SagaStartedEvent should be logged
    And a TxStartedEvent should be logged

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Transaction Completion
    Given a user transaction has been successfully processed
    When the system finalizes the booking
    Then a TxEndedEvent should be logged
    And a SagaEndedEvent should be logged

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Transaction Abortion
    Given a service is unavailable during the user's transaction
    When a timeout occurs
    Then a TxAbortedEvent should be logged

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Compensating Actions
    Given a transaction was aborted and requires compensation
    When the system executes compensating actions
    Then a TxCompensateAckSucceedEvent should be logged

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Handling Exceptions
    Given the system experiences a service failure
    And the user attempted to book 1 unit of car
    When the system processes the booking request
    Then the user is notified of the transaction failure
    And the booking records should reflect the cancellation

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Confirming Booking Validations
    Given the booking records are validated
    When the system updates the booking records
    Then the booking records should reflect the number of units booked and their confirmation statuses

  Scenario: Scenario 7: Cancellation Initiation
    Given the user decides to cancel a booking
    When the cancellation request is processed
    Then the system should update the booking orders to reflect the cancellation
