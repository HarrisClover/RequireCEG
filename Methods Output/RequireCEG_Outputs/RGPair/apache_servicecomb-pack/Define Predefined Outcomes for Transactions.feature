Feature: Define Predefined Outcomes for Transactions

  As a store owner
  I want to manage the transaction process effectively with proper logging
  So that I can ensure reliability and accountability in transactions

  Background:
    Given a transaction is initiated with a SagaStartedEvent
    And the system is ready to log transaction events

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Successful Transaction Flow
    Given the transaction proceeds without any issues
    When the system logs a TxStartedEvent
    Then a TxEndedEvent is logged upon successful completion
    And a SagaEndedEvent is recorded to indicate the end of the saga

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Transaction Failure due to Exception
    Given a transaction encounters an exception
    When the system detects an error
    Then a TxAbortedEvent is logged
    And compensatory actions are triggered and logged with a TxCompensateAckSucceedEvent

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Booking Process Completion
    Given the booking process is completed successfully
    When the system updates the booking status
    Then the confirmation status is set to 'Confirmed'
    And the number of booked units is accurately recorded

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Booking Cancellation
    Given a booking is canceled
    When the system processes the cancellation
    Then the booking status is updated to 'Canceled'
    And the count of booked units is decremented accordingly

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Transaction Completes Successfully and Logging Events Occur As Expected and Exceptions Do Not Occur All Together without Conflicts or Logging Errors where necessary logs are always maintained consistent sequentially without conflict to transaction process occurrence and exceptions recorded as such whenever they occur within captured actions as per established saga logging structure so as not to confuse any capture or records of any specific activity not logged in the transaction record test case in captured scenario for such outcomes. To check system integrity and logging feedback in line with expectations including transaction logs to maintained standards which are clear and precise per outcome before and after alongside after action for such transaction progress tracking actions should all succeed or confirming as consistent as in checking all logs recorded before or after each action is fully captured as intended in center console and before completing the saga's processes and after processing success. It proceeds without any breakdowns or any disjoint such that all logs after each control process is reflected properly in log feedback as expected and payments should also reflect success of transactions without any errors even within certain resets input in such that we get confirmation. In tracking for each but should also be noted and checked to further be recorded consistency showed the absence of issues with no failures or exceptions that prevent transactions from success or fall short of exchanges at end of phase. Logs maintained at overall cycles to be also logged while the success of each cycle and recording outcome in whole transactions attempted confirmation in equal relation captured modes in logging process should also be recorded consistently without having to skew capture logs or even lack thereof along their transactions cycles of the saga itself without mixing events across transactions and outcomes for completion processes and outcomes logged sequentially where logged where at least each would directly relate yet at the same time either must block other transactions from capturing within outcome for confirmations successive outcomes or failure independent of successful transactions independently of those outcomes existing order and being where exceptions or failures do not mismatch into those of successes alongside each captured cycle as together still ensuring there are no logging discrepancies within another relating process. Transaction should match well enough with their events and recorded logs accurately for those brought to process confirmed listings.
    Given the transaction complements its logs correctly
    When the outcome state of conditions falls inline thus corrective actions should proceed
    Then all states are confirmed and confirmed as captured without missing transactions and logs are verified to match correctly as always
    And nothing is unaccounted for in their occurrences with no overlaps or discrepancies present always

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Service Down During Transaction
    Given a service is found to be down during the transaction process
    When the system detects the service downtime
    Then the specific error is logged
    And necessary compensating actions are initiated
    Examples:
      | Service | Error Message | Compensatory Action |
      | Payment Service | Timeout Error | Initiate Refund Process |
      | Inventory Service | Service Unavailable | Roll Back Inventory Updates |
      | Shipping Service | Connection Refused | Alert Customer Support |
