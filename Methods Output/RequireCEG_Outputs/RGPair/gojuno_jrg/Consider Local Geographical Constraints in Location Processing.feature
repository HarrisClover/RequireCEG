Feature: Consider Local Geographical Constraints in Location Processing

  As a system user
  I want to determine if geographic coordinates fall within specified administrative boundaries
  So that I can obtain the precise address associated with those coordinates

  Background:
    Given the system is operational and accessible
    And valid administrative boundaries are defined

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Valid Coordinates within Bounds
    Given a user inputs valid geographic coordinates within city bounds
    When the system processes the coordinates
    Then the system returns the precise address associated with the valid coordinates
    And the status code is 'Success'

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Valid Coordinates near Point of Interest
    Given a user inputs valid geographic coordinates near a point of interest
    When the system processes the coordinates
    Then the system conducts a proximity analysis to find the closest available address
    And the most accurate match address is returned with status code 'Success'

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Invalid Input Handling
    Given a user inputs non-numeric coordinates
    When the system processes the input
    Then the system issues an error message for non-numeric coordinates
    And the status code is 'Non-numeric Coordinates'

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Multiple Matches Found
    Given a user inputs coordinates that match multiple potential addresses
    When the system processes the coordinates
    Then the system prioritizes and returns the best match based on the defined hierarchy
    And the status code is 'Ambiguous Match'

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Optimization during High Request Volume
    Given the system is experiencing high processing volume
    And the request volume exceeds the preset threshold
    When the user inputs a valid geographic coordinate
    Then the system implements optimizations for response times during peak processing without compromising accuracy

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Location Processing Based on Load
    Given the system is experiencing high processing volume
    And the request volume exceeds the preset threshold
    When the user inputs a valid geographic coordinate
    Then the system optimizes the response time without compromising accuracy
    Examples:
      | Input Coordinates | Expected Address | Status Code |
      | 40.7128, -74.0060 | 123 Example St, New York, NY | Success |
      | 34.0522, -118.2437 | 456 Example Ave, Los Angeles, CA | Success |
      | 51.5074, -0.1278 | 789 Example Rd, London, UK | Success |
