Feature: Ensure Proper Functionality of Metadata Filters

  As a system administrator
  I want the system to handle user input with metadata seamlessly, ensuring data integrity and security
  So that the application can function reliably without compromising performance due to unexpected input

  Background:
    Given the system has a mechanism to receive user input containing metadata
    And the system has predefined criteria for validating metadata

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Accept valid metadata
    Given valid metadata is provided by the user
    When the metadata is processed
    Then the metadata should be accepted and logged
    And no errors should be reported

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Sanitize invalid metadata
    Given invalid metadata that disrupts filtering is provided by the user
    When the metadata is processed
    Then the system should initiate a sanitization process for the metadata
    And the cleaned metadata should be logged without errors

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Validate custom metadata
    Given custom metadata is introduced via the plugin interface
    When the system validates the custom metadata
    Then the metadata should pass validation if it meets predefined criteria
    And it should be logged alongside any error reports

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Handle unhandled exceptions with active session
    Given an unhandled exception occurs during processing with an active session
    And the system captures relevant metadata including session and breadcrumb data
    When the exception is logged
    Then relevant metadata should be recorded successfully

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Handle unhandled exceptions with inactive session
    Given an unhandled exception occurs during processing with an inactive session
    When the exception is logged
    Then no relevant metadata should be recorded
