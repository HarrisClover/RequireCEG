Feature: Handle Stack Overflows

  As a system administrator
  I want to capture stack overflow errors along with their details
  So that I can monitor and debug issues effectively

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized with error reporting mechanisms
    And the user session tracking is enabled

  Scenario: Capture Stack Overflow Error
    Given a stack overflow occurs within the application
    When the system captures the error class and message
    Then the error is marked as an unhandled exception
    And the relevant metadata including device type and application version is included

  Scenario: Persist User Information
    Given a user is logged into the system
    When the user interacts with the application
    Then the user information is collected and persisted across sessions

  Scenario: Trigger Alert for High Severity Errors
    Given a stack overflow error is detected with high severity
    When the error is logged
    Then an alert is triggered to highlight the urgency of the issue

  Scenario: Avoid Duplicate Error Reports
    Given the system detects multiple stack overflow errors
    When the error reporting mechanism processes these errors
    Then only the most pertinent occurrence of the stack overflow error is reported

  Scenario: Log Manual Breadcrumbs
    Given the system captures manual breadcrumbs prior to the overflow
    And the breadcrumbs contain relevant interactions
    When the stack overflow error occurs
    Then the logging process includes the breadcrumbs for troubleshooting

  Scenario: Ensure Error Class and Message Captured
    Given a stack overflow occurs within the application
    When the system captures both the error class and message
    Then the error is classified as an unhandled exception

  Scenario: Collect Relevant Metadata on Error
    Given a stack overflow occurs within the application
    When the system processes the error
    Then relevant metadata such as device type and application version is available
    And user information is collected and automatically incorporated in the error report

  Scenario: Handle Multiple Errors
    Given the system detects multiple stack overflow errors
    When the error reporting mechanism processes these errors
    Then duplicate reports for the same issue are not sent

  Scenario: Log Manual Breadcrumbs dynamically
    Given manual breadcrumbs are captured before the overflow
    And the captured breadcrumbs include various user interactions
    When the stack overflow error occurs
    Then the logging process includes these manual breadcrumbs
    And manual breadcrumbs are logged for troubleshooting
