Feature: Handle Unusual Strings in User Data

  As a system administrator
  I want to analyze user-submitted data for unusual string patterns
  So that I can ensure data integrity and maintain system stability

  Background:
    Given a user submits data into the system
    And the system is configured to validate input data

  Scenario: Detect unusual valid strings
    Given the input includes valid character sequences deemed unusual but acceptable
    When the system processes the input data
    Then unusual valid strings should be captured
    And included in the error payload without disrupting error reporting

  Scenario: Sanitize prohibited characters
    Given the input contains prohibited characters
    When the system processes the input data
    Then the prohibited characters should be removed or replaced
    And the integrity of the valid data should be maintained

  Scenario: Log and track unusual strings
    Given the system detects unusual strings in user input of '<user-input>'
    And the system logs the corresponding metadata
    When multiple reports are submitted during the user session
    Then the system tracks and preserves user and device context
    And provides comprehensive traceability for troubleshooting

  Scenario: Document automatic breadcrumbs
    Given the input contains unusual strings that trigger automatic breadcrumbs
    When the system processes the input
    Then the automatic breadcrumbs should be documented in error reports

  Scenario: Log all valid data, including unusual strings
    Given the validation process detects valid data containing unusual strings
    When the system processes this data
    Then the system should log all valid data, including unusual strings
