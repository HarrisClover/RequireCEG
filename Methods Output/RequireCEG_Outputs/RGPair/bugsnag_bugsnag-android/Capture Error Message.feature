Feature: Capture Error Message

  As a system administrator
  I want to log errors based on specific conditions and severity levels
  So that I can effectively monitor and resolve issues in the system

  Background:
    Given an active user session
    And the system is monitoring error occurrences

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Null Pointer Dereference
    Given the system detects a null pointer dereferencing error
    When the error is logged
    Then the class should be 'NullPointerException'
    And the message should be 'Attempt to dereference a null object'
    And the severity level should be marked as 'Critical'

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Stack Overflow
    Given the system detects a stack overflow error
    When the error is logged
    Then the class should be 'StackOverflowError'
    And the message should be 'Stack overflow encountered'
    And the severity level should be marked as 'High'

  Scenario: Scenario 3: StrictMode Violation
    Given the system logs an unhandled StrictMode violation
    When the error is recorded
    Then the class should be 'StrictModeViolation'
    And the message should be 'Violation detected in StrictMode'
    And the severity level should be marked as 'Medium'

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Application Not Responding
    Given the system detects an Application Not Responding (ANR) condition
    When the error is captured
    Then the message should be 'Application Not Responding'
    And the severity level should be 'Critical'

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Logging User Data with Error
    Given the user information is accessible for logging
    When an error occurs during the session
    Then the payload must include the user data
    And the payload must be tagged as either handled or unhandled

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Validation of User Data
    Given there are unusual string characters in user data that need validation
    When the system processes the user data
    Then the unusual string characters should be validated and logged correctly

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Logging User Data
    Given the user information is accessible
    And the error payload must include the user data
    When an error occurs during the session
    Then the payload must be tagged as either handled or unhandled
    Examples:
      | Error Type | User Data | Handled/Unhandled |
      | NullPointerException | User123 | Handled |
      | StackOverflowError | User456 | Unhandled |
      | StrictModeViolation | User789 | Handled |
