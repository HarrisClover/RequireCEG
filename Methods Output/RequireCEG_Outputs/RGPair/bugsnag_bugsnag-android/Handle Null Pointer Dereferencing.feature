Feature: Handle Null Pointer Dereferencing

  As a software developer
  I want to implement a robust error-handling mechanism
  So that the application can capture and respond to null pointer exceptions effectively

  Background:
    Given the application is running
    And the user is logged into the system

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Unhandled Exception Occurs
    Given an unexpected null pointer dereference happens
    When the error is not caught by the system
    Then the payload should include the error class
    And a descriptive message detailing the nature of the error should be included
    And the severity level should be classified as critical
    And relevant user information such as user ID and session details should be captured

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Handled Exception Occurs
    Given the null pointer dereference error is caught by the system
    When the error is flagged as handled
    Then the payload should contain device type and operating system information
    And the application version should be included in the report

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Exception with Missing Required Fields
    Given there are missing required fields in the error payload
    When the error is logged
    Then an internal error report should be generated
    And the report should specifically identify the missing fields

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Breadcrumb Logging
    Given the user triggers an error in the application
    When the error occurs
    Then a breadcrumb trail leading up to the error should be recorded
    And duplicate reports for the same error event should not be generated

  Scenario: Scenario 5: User Data Filtering
    Given the application receives unusual user input
    When an error is captured
    Then the user data must be filtered to handle unusual strings
    And the anomaly should not interfere with error reporting

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Unhandled Exception Payload Generation
    Given the exception is unhandled
    When the application processes the error
    Then the payload should include error class, message, severity level, and user information
