Feature: Support for jsh Scripting

  As a user of jsh scripts
  I want the system to execute my scripts correctly with proper error handling and notifications
  So that I can easily troubleshoot issues and ensure smooth execution of my jsh scripts

  Background:
    Given a valid jsh script is provided
    And the user has cleared the cache prior to execution

  Scenario: Executing a valid jsh script
    Given the script initializes correctly
    When the user runs the script
    Then the system executes the script
    And displays the output in stdout

  Scenario: Running a script with incorrect parameters
    Given the user runs the script with incorrect parameters
    When the user attempts to run the script
    Then the system displays an error message detailing the nature of the issue

  Scenario: Checking for missing dependencies
    Given the user runs the script
    When there are missing dependencies
    Then the system alerts the user about the missing dependencies

  Scenario: Using deprecated jsh commands
    Given the user includes deprecated jsh commands in the script
    When the script is executed
    Then the system notifies the user of the deprecation of jsh commands
    And the system attempts to execute the script if feasible

  Scenario: Handling quotes in Windows parameters
    Given the user includes quotes in the parameters on a Windows environment
    When the user executes the script
    Then the system interprets and handles the quotes correctly

  Scenario: Managing jsh script wrappers
    Given the user attempts to create a wrapper for a jsh script
    When the directory structure is incorrect
    Then the system informs the user about the directory structure issue

  Scenario: Ensuring Java version compliance
    Given the user runs the script
    When Java version constraints are not complied with
    Then the system guarantees compliance with specified Java version constraints
