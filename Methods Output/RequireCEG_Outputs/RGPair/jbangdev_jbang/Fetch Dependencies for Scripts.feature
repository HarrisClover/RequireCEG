Feature: Fetch Dependencies for Scripts

  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure that necessary dependencies for my script are available
  So that I can run my script without encountering errors or conflicts

  Background:
    Given the user initiates a script fetch command
    And the system checks for required dependencies

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Successful Fetch Without Dependencies
    Given no dependencies are specified
    When the script is initiated
    Then the system automatically fetches required dependencies from the repository
    And the user receives a success message upon completion of fetching dependencies

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Fetch With Missing Dependencies
    Given the user specifies certain dependencies that are unavailable
    When the script is executed
    Then the system identifies the missing dependencies
    And the user receives an error message listing the unavailable items

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Version Mismatch Warning
    Given the user's script is not compatible with the current Java version
    When the fetch command is executed
    Then the system warns the user about the version mismatch
    And the script cannot be executed

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Handling Version Conflicts
    Given all dependencies are fetched successfully
    When there are version conflicts with the fetched dependencies
    Then the system alerts the user about the conflict
    And the user is proposed resolutions, such as upgrading or downgrading specific dependencies

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Dependency Check
    Given the user specifies dependencies as <dependencies>
    And the system checks availability of <number> dependencies
    When the fetch command is executed
    Then the system confirms availability of <available> dependencies
    Examples:
      | dependencies | number | available |
      | dependency1, dependency2 | 2 | both |
      | dependency3 | 1 | one |
      | dependency4, dependency5, dependency6 | 3 | none |
