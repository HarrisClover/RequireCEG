Feature: Launch JAR Files directly

  As a user of the system
  I want to launch JAR files by providing valid file paths
  So that I can execute Java applications seamlessly

  Background:
    Given the user wants to launch a JAR file
    And the system is ready to execute Java applications

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Launching a missing JAR file
    Given the user provides an invalid JAR file path
    When the user attempts to launch the file
    Then the system should display 'Error: The specified JAR file is missing.'

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Successful execution of a valid JAR file
    Given the user provides a valid JAR file path
    When the user launches the JAR file
    Then the output should display 'Operation successful'

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Runtime error during JAR execution
    Given the user provides a valid JAR file path
    And the execution of the JAR file fails due to runtime errors
    When the user launches the JAR file
    Then the system should display 'Execution failed: [specific error details]'

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Launching with a custom agent
    Given the user specifies a custom agent
    When the system verifies the agent's compatibility
    Then the system should confirm if the agent can launch the JAR file correctly

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Handling file paths with spaces
    Given the user provides a JAR file path that includes spaces
    When the system processes the path for execution
    Then the system should implement a quoting mechanism for compatibility

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Using deprecated commands or parameters
    Given the user specifies deprecated commands or parameters
    When the user launches the JAR file
    Then the system should notify 'Warning: [command/parameter] is deprecated, but the launch will proceed.'

  Scenario: Scenario 7: Execution failure due to runtime errors
    Given the user provides a valid JAR file path
    When the execution of the JAR file fails with runtime errors
    Then the system should display 'Execution failed: [specific error details]'.

  Scenario: Scenario 8: Agent cannot launch alongside the JAR file
    Given the user specifies an agent that cannot launch alongside the JAR file
    When the user attempts to execute the JAR file
    Then the system should handle errors or confirmations related to agent launch.
