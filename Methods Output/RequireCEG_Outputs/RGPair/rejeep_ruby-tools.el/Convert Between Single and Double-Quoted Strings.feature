Feature: Convert Between Single and Double-Quoted Strings

  As a user of the string conversion system
  I want to convert strings between single and double quote formats while preserving special characters and escape sequences
  So that I can easily manage and manipulate string formats without losing the integrity of the data

  Background:
    Given the user has a string to convert
    And the string is in either single or double quotes

  Scenario: Convert single-quoted string to double-quoted string
    Given the input is a single-quoted string
    When the system performs the conversion
    Then the output should be a double-quoted string
    And special characters should be preserved

  Scenario: Convert double-quoted string to single-quoted string
    Given the input is a double-quoted string
    When the system performs the conversion
    Then the output should be a single-quoted string
    And special characters should remain unaffected

  Scenario: Attempt conversion on an empty string
    Given the cursor is at the start of an empty string
    When the system performs the conversion
    Then the output should retain the quote marks intact

  Scenario: Attempt conversion with variable interpolation in double quotes
    Given the input is a double-quoted string with variable interpolation
    When the system interprets the interpolated variables
    Then the output should reflect the interpreted values

  Scenario: Attempt conversion with variable interpolation in single quotes
    Given the input is a single-quoted string with variable interpolation
    When the system performs the conversion
    Then the output should disable variable interpolation

  Scenario: Prevent conversion outside defined string context
    Given the input is not in a defined string context
    When the system attempts to convert the input
    Then no modifications should be made

  Scenario: Convert single-quoted string with special characters
    Given the input is a single-quoted string containing special characters
    When the system performs the conversion
    Then the output should be a double-quoted string with special characters preserved

  Scenario: Prevent modification outside defined string context
    Given the cursor is outside a well-defined string context
    When the system attempts to perform a conversion
    Then the output should not change and preserve the original text structure
