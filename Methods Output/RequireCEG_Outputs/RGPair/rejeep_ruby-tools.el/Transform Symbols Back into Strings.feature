Feature: Transform Symbols Back into Strings

  As a system developer
  I want to accurately convert data types for consistent processing
  So that the system can handle user inputs reliably and maintain code integrity

  Background:
    Given the system is set up to receive various input types
    And the input processing rules are defined

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Convert a symbol to a string
    Given an input symbol :example_symbol
    When the system processes the input
    Then the output should be 'example_symbol'
    And the input structure should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Transform a single-quoted string into a symbol
    Given the input is a single-quoted string 'example_string'
    When the system processes the input
    Then the output should be :example_string

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Handle double-quoted strings with interpolation
    Given the input is a double-quoted string containing interpolation "Hello, #{name}!"
    When the system processes the input
    Then the output should be :"Hello, #{name}!"

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Handle empty symbol input
    Given the input is an empty symbol :'' 
    When the system processes the input
    Then the output should be an empty string

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Retain special character formats after conversion
    Given an input symbol with special characters :example@123
    When the system processes the input
    Then the output should be 'example@123'

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Ensure immediate action retention after symbol conversion
    Given the cursor is located within a string in an interpolation context
    And the conversion action takes place immediately after a symbol's position
    When the system processes the input
    Then special character formats should be retained

  Scenario: Scenario 7: Check cursor location effect on interpolation context
    Given the cursor is located at the beginning of a string
    When the system processes the input
    Then the output should respect the cursor's contextual rules
