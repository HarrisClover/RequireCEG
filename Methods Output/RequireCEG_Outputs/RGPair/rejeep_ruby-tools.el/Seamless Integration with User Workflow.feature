Feature: Seamless Integration with User Workflow

  As a Ruby programmer
  I want Ruby tools mode to initiate automatically upon entering Ruby mode
  So that I can enhance my workflow efficiently when coding

  Background:
    Given the user is in Ruby mode
    And Ruby tools mode is available

  Scenario: Automatic Initiation of Ruby Tools Mode
    Given the user enters Ruby mode
    When Ruby tools mode initiates
    Then the Ruby tools mode should enhance the user workflow

  Scenario: Quick Edit Feature with Quotes
    Given the user clears a string while maintaining the original quote marks
    When the string is cleared
    Then the system should offer a quick-edit feature to preserve the quotes

  Scenario: Immediate Execution of Embedded Variables in Double-Quoted Strings
    Given the user enters a double-quoted string with interpolation
    When the string with interpolation is acknowledged
    Then the system executes embedded variables in the double-quoted string
    And the resulting string is displayed in real-time

  Scenario: Preservation of Special Characters in Single-Quoted Strings
    Given a double-quoted string is transformed into a single-quoted string
    When the transformation occurs
    Then all special characters within that string should be accurately retained

  Scenario: Cursor Position Respect during String to Symbol Conversion
    Given the user is converting a string to a symbol
    When the conversion action occurs
    Then the action respects the cursor's current position
    And empty strings should be converted without disrupting adjacent code

  Scenario: Single-Quoted String Behavior
    Given the user enters a single-quoted string
    When the string is evaluated
    Then the system does not alter or execute embedded variables in the single-quoted string

  Scenario: Transformation of Double-Quoted String to Single-Quoted String
    Given a double-quoted string is present
    When the double-quoted string is transformed into a single-quoted string
    Then the result should retain all special characters
