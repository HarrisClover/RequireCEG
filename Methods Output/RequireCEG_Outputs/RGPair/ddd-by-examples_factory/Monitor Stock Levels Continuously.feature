Feature: Monitor Stock Levels Continuously

  As a supply chain manager
  I want to ensure stock levels meet production requirements
  So that I can avoid shortages and fulfill customer demands

  Background:
    Given the system is monitoring real-time stock levels
    And predetermined production plans are established

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Demand Exceeds Stock Availability
    Given a demand change has occurred
    And unfulfilled orders are detected
    When the system checks stock levels
    Then an alert message should be issued
    And the message should state 'Alert: Demand has exceeded stock availability for the scheduled day'

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Stock Levels Below Minimum Threshold
    Given current stock levels are below the minimum threshold
    When the system assesses the stock levels
    Then a warning message should be displayed
    And the message should state 'Warning: Stock levels are below minimum threshold for fulfilling adjustments'

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Stock Conflict with Future Call-off Documents
    Given updates to stock levels indicate a conflict with future call-off documents
    When the system detects the conflict
    Then a notification should be sent
    And the notification should state 'Notification: Stock levels conflict with future call-off documents. Please confirm to proceed or adjust stock levels'

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Stock Levels Confirmed to Meet Demand Adjustments
    Given stock levels are confirmed to be sufficient to meet demand adjustments
    When the system finalizes production planning
    Then production schedules should be updated
    And relevant personnel should be notified about changes in production schedules

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Adjust Production Planning
    Given current stock levels are sufficient to meet demand adjustments
    And adjustments consider future call-off documents
    When the system finalizes production planning
    Then production schedules should be updated
    And relevant personnel should be notified of the changes
    Examples:
      | current stock | demand | call-off conflict | production schedule | notification |
      | 1000 units | 750 units | none | updated successfully | Notification sent |
      | 500 units | 600 units | none | update failed | Check stock levels |
      | 300 units | 250 units | conflict exists | not updated | Notification: please resolve conflict |
