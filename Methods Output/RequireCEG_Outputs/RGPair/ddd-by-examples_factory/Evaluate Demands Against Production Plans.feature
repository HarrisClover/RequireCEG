Feature: Evaluate Demands Against Production Plans

  As a production manager
  I want to analyze incoming demand requests and adjust production plans accordingly
  So that I can ensure optimal resource utilization and avoid shortages

  Background:
    Given the system has current stock levels and production schedules
    And there are incoming demand requests for today or future dates

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Handling Future Call-Off Document
    Given a future call-off document is received
    And the system has identified manual demand adjustments
    When the future call-off is processed
    Then the system overrides any manual adjustments due to the future call-off document
    And notifies the user with an alert message regarding demand adjustments

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Identifying Unfulfilled Demands
    Given unfulfilled demands that do not align with stock levels exist
    When the system analyzes the demands
    Then the system issues alerts detailing potential shortages on specific days

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Conflicting Demand Adjustments
    Given strong demand adjustments conflict with future call-offs
    When the system detects these discrepancies
    Then the system notifies the user with an alert message regarding demand adjustments

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Adjusting Production Schedules
    Given demand changes necessitate adjustments to production schedules
    When the system implements these adjustments
    Then the system shrinks the timelines of preceding tasks
    And delays succeeding tasks while considering retooling times

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Prioritizing Quality Assurance Tasks
    Given locked parts in stock are associated with quality assurance tasks
    When the system schedules production changes
    Then the system prioritizes all quality assurance tasks before additional scheduling changes

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Analyzing Demand Requests with Current Stock Levels and Alerts for Shortages or Adjustments Needed, High Quality, and Compliance Goals Required with Succeeding Tasks Delay Consideration and Preceding Task Timelines Shrinkage Which Coincide with All Quality Assurance Task Requirements Mixed with Future and Present Demand Requisition Handling Factors and Conflicting Situations Being Detected Alongside Automatic Adjustments via Alert Notifications and Today or Future Date Handling Scenarios with Clear Conditions Monitored in All Cases for Alerts Detailing Shortages or Adjustments: Demand Analysis Alert System Upgrade and Fair Utilization of Resources with a Demand Requisition Impact for Stock Levels Compliance to Ensure Mismatches Are Handle Proactively to Support Production Manager Requirements for Alerts Assuming These Conditions: Avoiding Shortage Notifications with Alert Messages to Users for Discrepancies in Demand Adjustments
    Given C1 is met and C2 is received, C3 is not met, C4 contains unfulfilled demand, C5 identified strong conflicting demand adjustments, not C6 being the adjustment request, C7 tasks are being monitored and not missed
    When the system analyzes demand request
    Then the system issues alerts detailing potential shortages or conflicts for specific days verifying production compliance

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Demand Adjustment and Alert
    Given the demand request is <demand>
    And the stock level is <stock-level>
    When the system processes the demand request
    Then the user is notified of <notification>
    Examples:
      | demand | stock-level | notification |
      | high demand | low stock | potential shortage alert |
      | adjusted demand | sufficient stock | production proceeds as scheduled |
      | excess demand | critical level | immediate reallocation required |
