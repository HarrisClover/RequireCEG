Feature: Identify Code Injection vulnerabilities

  As a system administrator
  I want to analyze user inputs for SQL injection risks
  So that I can protect the system from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity

  Background:
    Given the system has implemented input validation measures
    And the system is connected to an automated scanning tool

  Scenario: Valid user input is submitted
    Given a user enters safe input without any malicious SQL code
    When the user submits the input
    Then the system should confirm that the input is acceptable
    And the system displays a success message

  Scenario: Malicious SQL code is detected
    Given a user enters input containing SQL injection code
    When the user submits the input
    Then the system should trigger an alert for potential SQL injection
    And the input should be rejected and returned for correction

  Scenario: Input contains special characters
    Given a user enters input with special characters or unexpected patterns
    When the user submits the input
    Then the system should flag the input for manual review

  Scenario: Input fails validation measures
    Given a user enters input that does not pass the validation measures set by automated scans
    When the user submits the input
    Then the system should return a message informing the user that their input is not acceptable and requires correction
    And the input should not be processed further

  Scenario: Input passes scanning process
    Given a user enters input that passes the scanning process without any vulnerabilities detected
    When the user submits the input
    Then the system should display a success message confirming the input meets security standards for code injection
