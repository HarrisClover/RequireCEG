Feature: Ensure Secure Transmission of Sensitive Information

  As a store owner
  I want to protect sensitive user information during transmission
  So that I can ensure customer privacy and maintain trust

  Background:
    Given the application handles sensitive information
    And user credentials may be included in the data

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Transmit Data Over HTTPS
    Given the application is configured to use HTTPS
    When a user submits sensitive information
    Then all data must be transmitted over HTTPS
    And no information can be intercepted

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Enforce Case-Sensitive Password Input
    Given a user attempts to log in
    When the user submits their password
    Then the application must validate the password as case-sensitive

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Set Secure Flags on Session Cookies
    Given a user's session is active
    When the application generates session cookies
    Then the 'secure' and 'httpOnly' flags must be set

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Prevent Browser Caching of Sensitive Data
    Given sensitive data is present
    When the user accesses the application
    Then the application must prevent browser caching

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Session Timeout Invalidation
    Given the session has been inactive for 'timeout-period'
    When the session timeout occurs
    Then the session ID must be invalidated

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Immediate Session ID Invalidation Upon Logout
    Given a user is logged out
    When the logout action is performed
    Then the session ID must be immediately invalidated

  Scenario: Scenario 7: CORS Request Validation
    Given a CORS request is made
    When user authorization levels are assessed
    Then access must be restricted based on user authorization levels

  Scenario: Scenario 8: Block Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data
    Given unauthorized access to sensitive data occurs
    Then access must be blocked
