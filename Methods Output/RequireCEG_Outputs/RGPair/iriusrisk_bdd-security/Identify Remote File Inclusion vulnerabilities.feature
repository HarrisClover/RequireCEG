Feature: Identify Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities

  As a security analyst
  I want the application to conduct automated security scans to detect Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities
  So that I can identify and mitigate unauthorized file access risks

  Background:
    Given the application receives file paths as input
    And the security scan is initiated using OWASP ZAP

  Scenario: Unauthorized file access detection
    Given a file path is found that allows unauthorized access
    When the security scan completes
    Then a vulnerability alert should be generated indicating the path is compromised
    And the system logs the details of the compromised path

  Scenario: Weak HTTP headers detection
    Given the security scan has evaluated the HTTP headers
    When the scan detects weak or missing HTTP headers
    Then a warning should be issued regarding possible exposure to vulnerabilities

  Scenario: Detecting Remote File Inclusion risk due to session management
    Given the user has logged out or is inactive for a period
    When the session ID remains valid
    Then the system should flag a potential Remote File Inclusion risk

  Scenario: CORS settings validation
    Given the application has CORS settings applied as <cors-settings>
    When a security check is conducted on the CORS settings
    Then the system should issue a warning if the settings do not appropriately restrict cross-origin requests

  Scenario: Weak SSL configuration detection
    Given the application has been scanned for SSL configuration
    When the scan detects support for weak protocols
    Then the system should issue a critical alert highlighting the risks
    And recommend strong SSL configurations to mitigate potential file inclusion attacks

  Scenario: Weakness in user authentication mechanisms
    Given the user authentication mechanisms are evaluated
    When weaknesses are detected in the mechanisms
    Then the application should trigger a requirement for enhanced user validation
    And input sanitization measures to reduce vulnerabilities

  Scenario: Warning on potential vulnerabilities due to CORS settings
    Given the application has CORS settings applied that may be too permissive
    When a security check is conducted
    Then the system should issue a warning regarding possible exposure to vulnerabilities
