Feature: Implement OWASP ZAP for scanning

  As a security engineer
  I want to automate security scans using OWASP ZAP
  So that I can identify vulnerabilities in a secure environment

  Background:
    Given the OWASP ZAP scanner is configured with high strength attack policies
    And the scan is initiated in a secure environment

  Scenario: Detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities
    Given the scanning process is initiated
    When the scanner analyzes the web application
    Then any SQL injection vulnerabilities should be logged
    And the vulnerabilities should be categorized and logged as medium or high risk

  Scenario: Detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
    Given the OWASP ZAP scan is in progress
    When the application is tested for XSS vulnerabilities
    Then all detected XSS vulnerabilities should be logged
    And their risk levels must be assessed as medium or higher

  Scenario: Detect remote OS command injection vulnerabilities
    Given the web application is undergoing the security scan
    When the scanner checks for command injection vulnerabilities
    Then any detected vulnerabilities should be classified
    And alerts should be generated for medium and high-risk vulnerabilities

  Scenario: Validate HTTP security headers
    Given the scan report is generated
    And the following headers are checked: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security
    When the scanner analyzes the HTTP responses
    Then if headers are absent, they should be automatically configured
    And the system should ensure necessary HTTP headers are present

  Scenario: Session management verification
    Given a user is logged in
    When the user logs out or remains inactive for the set duration
    Then the session ID must be invalidated
    And session cookies must have security flags such as 'secure' and 'httpOnly'

  Scenario: Validate SSL configurations
    Given the system is checked for SSL setup
    When weak protocols are detected
    Then they should be disabled in favor of strong TLS versions
    And perfect forward secrecy must be enforced

  Scenario: Validate CORS requests
    Given the system processes CORS requests
    When an unauthorized access attempt occurs
    Then the system should block the request based on user authorization level

  Scenario: Ensure data confidentiality
    Given sensitive information is processed
    When the browser cache is checked
    Then measures must be implemented to prevent sensitive information storage
    And secure transmission methods must be utilized such as HTTPS

  Scenario: Establish strong user authentication
    Given user credentials need to be validated
    When credentials are sent by the user
    Then the system should enforce HTTPS for credential transmission
    And passwords must be case-sensitive

  Scenario: Verify generation of logs
    Given the scan has identified vulnerabilities
    When the vulnerability assessment is completed
    Then logs must be generated for review of detected vulnerabilities
    And the system must confirm successful reporting of the scan

  Scenario: Request for remediation
    Given the system detects medium or high-risk vulnerabilities
    When the vulnerabilities are assessed
    Then the system should recommend immediate remediation efforts
    And the alert for these vulnerabilities must be generated
