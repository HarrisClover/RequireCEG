Feature: Restrict Cross-Origin Access

  As a system administrator
  I want to restrict access based on origin domain and CORS headers
  So that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access

  Background:
    Given a request is received
    And the user is authenticated

  Scenario: Allow access from authorized domain
    Given the request originates from an allowed domain
    And the user possesses the requisite authorization level
    When the request is processed
    Then the user should receive 'Access Granted: You have permission to view this data'

  Scenario: Deny access from unauthorized domain
    Given the request originates from an unauthorized domain
    When the request is processed
    Then the user should receive 'Access Denied: Unauthorized Domain'

  Scenario: CORS error due to missing headers
    Given the request is missing proper CORS headers
    When the request is processed
    Then the user should receive 'CORS Error: Missing or Invalid CORS Headers'

  Scenario: Allow access based on user authentication with authorization
    Given the user is authenticated with proper authorization
    And the request originates from an allowed domain
    When the request is processed
    Then the user should receive 'Access Granted: You have permission to view this data'

  Scenario: Deny access due to missing domain authorization
    Given the request does not originate from an allowed domain
    When the request is processed
    Then the user should receive 'Access Denied: Unauthorized Domain'

  Scenario: CORS error due to request being unauthorized
    Given the request is missing proper CORS headers
    When the request is processed by an unauthorized user
    Then the user should receive 'CORS Error: Missing or Invalid CORS Headers'
