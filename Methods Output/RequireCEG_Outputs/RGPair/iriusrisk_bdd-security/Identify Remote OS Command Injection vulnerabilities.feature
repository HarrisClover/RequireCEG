Feature: Identify Remote OS Command Injection vulnerabilities

  As a system administrator
  I want the system to validate user command string inputs for potential vulnerabilities
  So that I can prevent unauthorized command execution and ensure system security

  Background:
    Given the system has a list of known malicious patterns
    And the system is equipped to log executed commands and anomalies

  Scenario: Valid command input
    Given a user submits a command string without special characters
    When the system evaluates the command string
    Then the command should be executed normally
    And the transaction should be logged

  Scenario: Invalid command input - malicious pattern
    Given a user submits a command string containing special characters
    When the system evaluates the command string
    Then the system should display an error message indicating that the input is unsafe
    And the command should not be executed

  Scenario: Logging and alerting on anomalies during command execution
    Given a user submits a command string that triggers an alert during logging
    When the system detects anomalous behavior
    Then the appropriate security personnel should be notified

  Scenario: Successful command execution without anomalies
    Given a user submits a command string that completes execution successfully
    When the system evaluates the command execution
    Then the command should be executed normally
    And no alert should be triggered

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Evaluate command input
    Given the command input string is <inputString>
    When the system evaluates the command input
    Then the outcome should be <outcome>
    Examples:
      | inputString | outcome |
      | validCommand | executed normally |
      | rm -rf / | input is unsafe |
      | echo Hello | executed normally |
      | ; DROP TABLE users; | input is unsafe |
