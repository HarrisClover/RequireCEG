Feature: Identify Path Traversal vulnerabilities

  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure file path inputs are validated to prevent unauthorized access
  So that I can maintain the security and integrity of the system

  Background:
    Given the user is logged into the application
    And the system is configured to check file paths

  Scenario: Valid path input
    Given the user provides a valid file path
    When the application validates the path
    Then the application should process the request without any errors
    And no log entry should be created

  Scenario: Path traversal attempt
    Given the user attempts to access a file using a path with '../'
    When the application validates the path
    Then the application should log the path traversal attempt
    And the user should receive an 'access denied' message

  Scenario: Session inactivity handling
    Given the user has been inactive for a certain period
    When the user attempts to interact with the system
    Then the system should invalidate the user session
    And the user should be notified of the session timeout

  Scenario: Invalid path input with path traversal
    Given the user provides a path that includes '../'
    When the application processes the path
    Then the application should log the path traversal attempt
    And the user should receive an 'access denied' message

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Invalid path input handling
    Given the user provides a path that includes <path-component>
    When the application processes the path
    Then the outcome should be a <response>
    Examples:
      | path-component | response |
      | ../secret | access denied |
      | ../../etc/passwd | access denied |
      | validpath/file.txt | access granted |
