Feature: Prevent Unauthorized Access Based on User Authorization Levels

  As a user
  I want to ensure that my access to resources is based on my authorization level
  So that I can receive appropriate access or notifications based on my role

  Background:
    Given the user is logged in
    And the user's authorization level is established

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Access Granted with Sufficient Authorization
    Given the user requests access to a resource
    And the resource requires an authorization level equal to or lower than the user's level
    When the system checks the user's authorization level
    Then the access should be granted
    And the user is directed to the requested resource

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Access Denied with Insufficient Authorization
    Given the user requests access to a resource
    And the resource requires an authorization level higher than the user's level
    When the system checks the user's authorization level
    Then the access should be denied
    And the system should return a '403 Forbidden' message

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Access Denied Due to Role Restrictions
    Given the user is logged in
    And the user attempts to access a resource not permitted for their role
    When the user requests access to the resource
    Then the user should be redirected to their dashboard
    And a message explaining the restriction should be displayed

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Prompt to Log In
    Given the user is not logged in
    When the user attempts to access a resource
    Then the system should prompt the user to log in to proceed further

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Automatic Logout Due to Inactive Session
    Given the user is logged in
    And the user's session is found to be inactive
    When the user tries to access any resource
    Then the user should be automatically logged out
    And the user should be required to provide valid credentials to re-establish access

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Access Management for Logged Out Users
    Given the user is not logged in
    When the user attempts to access any resource
    Then the user should be prompted to log in
    And the request is not processed

  Scenario: Scenario 7: Access Denial for Unauthorized Users
    Given the user is logged in
    And the user's authorization level is below the required level for the resource
    When the user requests access to the resource
    Then the user should see a '403 Forbidden' message
    And access should be denied
