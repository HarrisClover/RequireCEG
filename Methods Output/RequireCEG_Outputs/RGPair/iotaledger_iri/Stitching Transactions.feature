Feature: Stitching Transactions

  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure seamless stitching of transactions between nodes
  So that the system maintains reliable interactions and prevents crashes

  Background:
    Given a transaction involving main and side tangles
    And a stable state of interactions between nodes

  Scenario: Transaction Completion
    Given all required node interactions are stable
    When a transaction is initiated
    Then the system confirms reliable interactions
    And the transaction state is logged and validated

  Scenario: Node Synchronization Error
    Given a node fails to bootstrap or synchronize
    When a synchronization attempt is made
    Then the system generates an error message 'Node synchronization error: unable to bootstrap or synchronize'

  Scenario: Zero-Value Transaction Confirmation
    Given a zero-value transaction is initiated
    When the transaction is referenced by specific milestones
    Then the system confirms the zero-value transaction and updates the state

  Scenario: API Call Verification - GetNodeInfo
    Given an API call GetNodeInfo is initiated
    When the system processes the call
    Then the system returns accurate responses for GetNodeInfo

  Scenario: API Call Verification - GetNeighbors
    Given an API call GetNeighbors is initiated
    When the system processes the call
    Then the system returns accurate responses for GetNeighbors

  Scenario: API Call Verification - Add Neighbor
    Given an API call Add Neighbor is initiated
    When the system processes the call
    Then the system returns accurate responses for Add Neighbor

  Scenario: API Call Verification - Remove Neighbor
    Given an API call Remove Neighbor is initiated
    When the system processes the call
    Then the system returns accurate responses for Remove Neighbor

  Scenario: Transaction Pruning Restriction
    Given a transaction exceeds the established pruning depth
    When an attempt to access the old transaction is made
    Then the system restricts access to all old transactions

  Scenario: Value Transaction State Logging
    Given a value transaction is processed following the confirmation process
    When the system validates the transaction state
    Then the system logs the value transaction state before confirmation
    And the transaction is considered complete
