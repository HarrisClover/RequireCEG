Feature: Crash Avoidance Mechanisms

  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure consistent transactions and manage recovery protocols
  So that the system remains stable and user data is protected during failures

  Background:
    Given that there is a node responsible for verifying transaction consistency
    And that the system maintains a log of all transactions and errors

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Detecting Inconsistent Transactions
    Given a transaction is submitted to the node
    When the node verifies the transaction for consistency
    Then if the transaction is inconsistent, an error message should be logged
    And the message should be 'Inconsistent transaction: Transaction cannot be processed'

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Reverting to Stable State on Synchronization Failure
    Given that the system tries to synchronize from Local Snapshot
    When an inconsistency is detected during synchronization
    Then the system must revert to the last stable state
    And notify the user with 'Synchronization failed due to inconsistency. Reverting to stable state. Please be cautious of potential crash risk.'

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Automatic Recovery After Node Crash
    Given that a crash occurs while processing transactions
    When the node detects the crash
    Then the node should automatically attempt recovery
    And log the entry stating 'Node crash detected. Engaging recovery protocol.'

  Scenario: Scenario 4: API Call Retry Mechanism
    Given an API call is made to an unreachable node
    When the call fails
    Then the system must retry the API call up to three times
    And log the number of attempts in the format 'API call failed after X attempts. Node unreachable.'

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Transaction Access Compliance Above Pruning Depth
    Given a transaction that has been pruned
    When a user attempts to retrieve this transaction
    Then the system must ensure transactional access compliance above the designated pruning depth
    And notify the user with 'Access denied: Attempted retrieval of transactions below pruning depth.'

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Unauthorized Access Attempt for Pruned Transactions
    Given an attempt is made to handle pruned transactions below the pruning depth
    When the system detects this unauthorized access
    Then the system must enforce access controls
    And log the incident with 'Unauthorized access attempt detected for pruned transactions. Incident logged for review.'

  Scenario: Scenario 7: API Call Unreachable Node
    Given an API call cannot reach the specified node
    When the system detects the unreachable node
    Then the system must attempt to retry the API call
    And if unsuccessful, log the incident indicating an unreachable node.

  Scenario: Scenario 8: Node Consistency Check Failure
    Given a transaction is being processed
    When the transaction consistency check fails
    Then log an error message indicating 'Inconsistent transaction: Transaction cannot be processed.'
    And ensure no further processing of the transaction is executed.
