Feature: Remove Neighbor API Function

  As a node in the network
  I want to remove a neighbor from my neighbor list safely and efficiently
  So that I can maintain an accurate and consistent state within the network

  Background:
    Given a node has a current list of neighbors
    And there are pending transactions with some neighbors

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Successfully removing a neighbor
    Given the neighbor exists in the current neighbors list
    When a request is made to remove the specified neighbor
    Then the neighbor should be removed from the list
    And the system should return 'Neighbor successfully removed.'

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Attempting to remove a non-existent neighbor
    Given the neighbor does not exist in the current neighbors list
    When a request is made to remove the specified neighbor
    Then the system should return 'Error: Neighbor not found.'

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Handling pending transactions with a removed neighbor
    Given the neighbor exists in the current neighbors list
    And there are pending transactions with the neighbor
    When the neighbor is removed from the list
    Then the system should validate the pending transactions
    And appropriate actions should be taken to complete or cancel these transactions

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Synchronizing the node's state with remaining neighbors after successful removal and pending transactions cancellation or completion, if applicable, is managed effectively but only if there was at least one remaining neighbor available for synchronization while having pending transactions to complete or cancel afterward in due process flow and coordination of states involved during node transitions of connection state in the neighborhood list transition affecting the internal state within the network environment fully functional on those transactions mentioned above existence being requisite in these scenarios as anticipated operational conditions reflecting realistic node interactions during standard operational procedures connecting across transactional states of these neighbor interactions across the complete structural relationships of network nodes involved with transactions existing based upon node inclusion and dependents existents alongside neglected cancellation and completion outcomes during time and reflection of connected states acting as resultant transitions impacting overall coordination efficiency optimizing placements throughout the platform interactions during standard optimally functioning states performing effectively during these scenarios across the transactions interrelated overall operations achieving expected results expected solely conditioned throughout these anticipated network operational consistency criteria governs essential interactions categorized across these desired requirements functioning productively throughout completion of expected neighbor interactions in effective management process that ultimately creates a dynamic experience for overall optimization across connections qualified within the outreach periods present effectively operational with operational conditions aimed towards improving structural adaptabilities should the transitions effectively synchronize amongst these operations linked throughout actions defined smoothly and adjusting accordingly upon completion while performing maintenance throughout the platforms network efficiency across all operational highly sophisticated connections during these guides ultimately meet the demand of efficient optimal interactions sustaining throughout conditions formed and aligned based upon their existing operational structures streamlined extending further confirming beyond transactional requirements for processing efficiently whilst managing control systems centered functionally throughout these systems detected across connections achieving stable environments optimally fitting within multi-step successful proceedings while ensuring effective methods and scenarios conveyed clearly across these transitions working harmoniously representing accurate projections within structure with defined processes fulfilled positively throughout ensuring satisfaction upon completion being showcased and reflected coherently during succeeding profiles and operational conditions meeting aimed personalized results as anticipated successfully maximizing connections entirely operationally throughout these developments enhancing network performance conducive across the structures in place inferred should these conditions evolve transcendently towards smooth predictions tackled attentively altogether engaging meticulously throughout anticipated systems aimed encompassing these engagements evaluated thoroughly fulfilling the criteria expected following through successfully configuration of adequate meeting fulfillment should the operations execute flawlessly as predicted anticipated enhancing connections effectively communicating throughout achieving well directed operational capabilities optimally crafted and enhancing outcomes succeeding throughout productive engagements monitored proficiently ensuring fulfillment altogether creating coordination through completion operating continuously on conditions dependent widely facilitating meeting and achieving criteria expected ultimately managing output effectively amidst these effective scenarios engaged through operational dialogues throughout these surrounding circumstances operating efficiently accomplishing these successful operational engagements envisioned as per transactional conditions effective fulfilling connections arise formed collectively ensuring satisfaction deriving accuracy processed respectfully demonstrating operational proficiency consistently across entire outcomes perpetuated executing through these factors adhered collectively upon conclusion achieving official recognition validating the respective initiatives confirming validations expected successfully achieving operational expectations collectively achieved entirely through management consistently pursuing expectations desired outcomes fulfilled ultimately operating towards resolutions should the necessary conditions arise effectively managing engagements efficiently tailoring throughout fulfillment expectations maximizing connectivity expectations engaged within conditions representing goals desired through efficient solutions catered effectively providing accurate well placed coordinated seamlessly operational frameworks established throughout successfully adhering upon expectations delineated verification reflecting the efficiency distinctly throughout operational integrations maintaining accuracy invariably expected ensuring fulfillment ultimately processing positively engaging effectively throughout operational executions achieved continually operating under expectations defined clearly featuring content operating cohesively achieving success well implemented structurally throughout operational conditions fulfilled seamlessly ensuring timeless fulfillment towards managing connection expectations successfully secured overall

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Remove Neighbor Edge Case
    Given the neighbor's ID is '<neighbor-id>'
    And the neighbor exists in the current neighbors list
    When a request is made to remove the neighbor
    Then the response should be '<response>'
    Examples:
      | neighbor-id | response |
      | NodeA | Neighbor successfully removed. |
      | NodeB | Error: Neighbor not found. |
