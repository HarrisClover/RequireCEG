Feature: Automatic Refresh of Access Tokens

  As a user of the application
  I want the system to automatically refresh my access token before it expires
  So that I can continue using the application without interruption

  Background:
    Given the user is logged into the application
    And the access token has a defined expiration time

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Access token nearing expiration
    Given the access token expires in 4 minutes
    When the user attempts to make an API request
    Then the system should initiate the token refresh process
    And the user should receive a successful token refresh notification

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Access token has expired
    Given the access token has expired
    When the user attempts to make an API request
    Then the system should prevent the API request until the token is refreshed

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Token refresh failure due to invalid refresh token
    Given the refresh token is invalid
    When the system attempts to refresh the access token
    Then the system should log an error message
    And the user should receive a warning message indicating that the token refresh has failed

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Token refresh failure due to network issue
    Given the refresh token is valid
    When the system attempts to refresh the access token and a network error occurs
    Then the system should log an error message
    And the user should receive a warning message indicating that the token refresh has failed

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Access token refresh process
    Given the current access token is <token-status>
    And the refresh token is <refresh-token-status>
    When the system checks the access token expiration
    Then the system should <expected-outcome>
    Examples:
      | token-status | refresh-token-status | expected-outcome |
      | valid and not expiring | valid | initiate refresh process |
      | valid and expiring soon | valid | initiate refresh process |
      | invalid | valid | log error and notify user |
      | valid | invalid | log error and notify user |
