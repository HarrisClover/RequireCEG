Feature: Implement Testing for API Endpoint Functionality

  As an API tester
  I want to validate the functionality of various API endpoints for system operations
  So that I can ensure that the API behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements

  Background:
    Given the API is deployed and accessible
    And I have the necessary credentials for authentication

  Scenario: Health Check Endpoint
    Given the API is operational
    When I send a request to the health check endpoint
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response body should be non-empty and confirm that the system is running

  Scenario: User Account Management - Update Balance
    Given a user has a current account balance of $500
    When I process a credit transaction of $150
    Then the user's account balance should be updated to $650

  Scenario: User Account Management - Retrieve Balance
    Given the user's account balance is $650
    When I retrieve the account details
    Then the displayed balance should reflect $650

  Scenario: Upload Project Data
    Given a user has project data ready for upload
    When the user uploads the project data
    Then the response should confirm successful upload
    And include relevant project information in the confirmation

  Scenario: Calculator Feature - Addition
    Given two integers 5 and 10
    When I request addition of these integers
    Then the response should return the correct sum of 15

  Scenario: Book Store Query - Valid Entry
    Given a book title exists in the database
    When I search for the book by title
    Then the response should provide the book details

  Scenario: Book Store Query - Invalid Entry
    Given the book title does not exist in the database
    When I search for the book by title
    Then the response should indicate that no entries were found

  Scenario: Multiple Data Representations for Books
    Given multiple books exist in the database
    When I query for all books
    Then the response should return a list of books
    And for individual book details, it should return a map structure

  Scenario: Testing API Version Information
    Given the API has a versioning endpoint
    When I request the version information
    Then the response should include the correct version details
    And the response should adhere to the specified format

  Scenario: User Account Management - Ensure Account Details Retrieved After Balance Update
    Given the user's account balance has been updated
    When I retrieve the account details
    Then the account details should reflect the latest changes made

  Scenario: Testing API Outcomes and Expected Payloads
    Given testing is implemented for all API endpoint outcomes
    When I check the test results
    Then all outcomes should match the expected payloads specified in the requirements

  Scenario: Check for Multiple Representations for Book Queries
    Given multiple data representations are supported for book queries
    When I request different formats for book data
    Then the API should return the appropriate data representation as specified

  Scenario: Ensure No Entries Found Message When No Books Exist
    Given no entries were found for the requested query
    When I search for the book by title that does not exist
    Then the API should return a message indicating no entries were found
