Feature: Next Page Button Functionality

  As a user
  I want to navigate to the next page seamlessly
  So that I can interact with the new content without delay

  Background:
    Given the WebDriver instance is initialized
    And the user is on the first page

  Scenario: Scenario 1: WebDriver Initialization Required
    Given the WebDriver instance is not initialized
    When the user clicks the 'next page' button
    Then the system invokes the Before hook to confirm the initial state is null
    And the system launches the WebDriver
    And the system transitions to the second page successfully

  Scenario: Scenario 2: WebDriver Already Initialized
    Given the WebDriver instance is already initialized and tagged appropriately
    When the user clicks the 'next page' button
    Then the system maintains the WebDriver instance state
    And the system transitions to the second page successfully

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Handling Wait During Navigation
    Given the WebDriver is initialized and tagged appropriately as valid
    When the user clicks the 'next page' button
    Then the system uses effective wait handling strategies during navigation
    And the transition is seamless and reliable

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Handling Wait with Invalid Tag
    Given the WebDriver is initialized and tagged appropriately as invalid
    When the user clicks the 'next page' button
    Then the system uses effective wait handling strategies during navigation
    And the transition may not be seamless and reliable

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Handling Wait with Timeout
    Given the WebDriver is initialized and tagged appropriately as timeout
    When the user clicks the 'next page' button
    Then the system uses effective wait handling strategies during navigation
    And the transition may experience delays

  Scenario: Scenario 6: Employing Effective Wait Handling Strategies
    Given the WebDriver instance is already initialized and tagged appropriately
    When the user clicks the 'next page' button
    Then the system employs effective wait handling strategies during navigation
    And the transitioned page content loads without delay
