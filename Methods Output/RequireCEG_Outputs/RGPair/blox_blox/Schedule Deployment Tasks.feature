Feature: Schedule Deployment Tasks

  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure deployment tasks are up-to-date before proceeding with deployment
  So that I can maintain system integrity and service continuity

  Background:
    Given the system has established criteria for pre-deployment checks
    And a deployment task is waiting for execution

  Scenario: Check if Deployment Task is Up-to-Date
    Given the deployment task is assessed
    When the task is found to be up-to-date
    Then the system logs a message indicating that no replacement is needed
    And the process is terminated

  Scenario: Proceed with Deployment When Task is Not Up-to-Date
    Given the deployment task is assessed
    When the task is found to be not up-to-date
    Then the system proceeds with the deployment process

  Scenario: Capture Error During Deployment
    Given the deployment process is initiated
    When an error occurs during deployment
    Then the system captures the error details
    And logs the error efficiently

  Scenario: Notify User of Deployment Failure
    Given an error has been logged during deployment
    When the user needs to be informed
    Then the system sends a notification specifying the nature of the failure
    And provides potential next steps to resolve the issue

  Scenario: Implement Replace After Terminate Strategy
    Given the deployment involves environments requiring daemon deployment
    When the old deployment is terminated
    Then the system confirms it is no longer active
    And proceeds with deploying the new task

  Scenario: User Notified When Deployment Task Fails Pre-Deployment Check
    Given the deployment task does not meet the criteria established during the pre-deployment check
    When the task is assessed
    Then the system notifies the user with a message specifying the nature of the failure
    And provides potential next steps to resolve the issue

  Scenario: Terminate Previous Deployment Before New Deployment
    Given the deployment process is initiated
    When the old deployment is found to be still active
    Then the system terminates the old deployment
    And verifies that the old deployment is no longer active

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Deployment Task Assessment
    Given the deployment task status is '<status>'
    When the system performs a pre-deployment check
    Then the outcome should be '<outcome>'
    Examples:
      | status | outcome |
      | up-to-date | No replacement needed; process terminated |
      | not up-to-date | Proceed with deployment |
