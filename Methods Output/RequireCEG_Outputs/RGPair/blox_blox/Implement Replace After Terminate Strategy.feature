Feature: Implement Replace After Terminate Strategy

  As a deployment manager
  I want to ensure that deployment tasks are handled correctly based on their current version state
  So that we can maintain environment stability and provide clear feedback during the deployment process

  Background:
    Given a deployment task is scheduled for an environment
    And the system has the current version information

  Scenario: Check for up-to-date task
    Given the scheduled task is up-to-date
    When validation is performed
    Then the message 'No changes made' should be printed
    And the existing task should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Deploy new task when outdated
    Given the scheduled task is not up-to-date
    When the deployment process starts
    Then the existing task should be terminated
    And the new task should be deployed

  Scenario: Rollback on deployment error
    Given the new task is being deployed
    When an error occurs during the deployment
    Then the environment should be rolled back to its previous state
    And an error message detailing the issue should be generated

  Scenario: Ensure multiple environments are managed
    Given multiple environments are managed for the deployment task
    When the deployment is initiated for each environment
    Then the deployment task handling and validation logic must apply to each environment

  Scenario: Check for error condition during deployment
    Given the deployment task is not up-to-date
    And an error occurs during the deployment process
    When validation steps are performed
    Then the existing task should be terminated
    And the rollback procedure should initiate
