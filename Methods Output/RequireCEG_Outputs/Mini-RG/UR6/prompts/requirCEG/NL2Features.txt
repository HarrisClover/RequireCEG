Features of Feature Tree: [
(1) Organize different software functions into logical groups based on inheritance relationships.
(2) The structure is based on Ishikawa diagram.
(3) There are usually three levels. Level 1 (L1), level 2 (L2), and level 3 (L3). L2 features are subfeatures of L3 features, and L3 features are subfeatures of L2 features.
(4) A feature tree has only one L1 feature and many L2 or L3 features, and L3 features are not required.

Output example ("ID": "Feature Name"):
{
  "L1": "Feature Tree Name",
  "L2.1": "Function1",
  "L3.1.1": "Subfunction1",
  "L3.1.2": "Subfunction2",
  "L2.2": "Function2",
  "L3.2.1": "Subfunction1",
  "L3.2.2": "Subfunction2"
  ...
}

Instructions:
1. Comprehensive analysis of all functional requirements contained in {user requirements}.
2. The functional requirements are organized and expanded into Feature trees according to {Features of Feature Tree}.
3. Ensure that the features contain as many meaningful features as possible, include all the must-be features, one-dimensional features, attractive features and indifferent features.

Constraints:
1. Ensure that the "Feature Name" is more meaningful and detailed.
2. Please use the json format {L1:, L2.1:, L3.1.1:...,L2.2, L3.2.1,...} for the output like {Output example} without any list.
