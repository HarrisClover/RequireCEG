Atomic C and E: [
{Atomic Replacement Flag}
]

Logical Expressions: [
{CEG Replacement Flag}
]

Instructions:
1. Intervene conditional nodes (Cx) according to the order of expressions in the {logical expression}. By default all condition nodes are initially true and intervention is do(Cx=False).
2. Find all {logical Expressions} associated with condition (Cx) and add them to "Affected Expressions".
3. The specific meaning of the corresponding condition C and action E is obtained from {Atomic C and E}, and the system description is generated according to the result of the inferred intervention.
Constraints:
1. The specific meaning of the corresponding condition C and action E is obtained from {atoms C and E} to replace the affected expression, and then the natural language system description is formed based on the expression.
2. The output json format is:
 {
    "QA n": 
    {
        "Intervention": "do(Cx = False)",
        "Description": "Natural language system description",
        "Affected Expressions": ["Exp x",...],
    },
    "QA n+x": 
    ...
 }
