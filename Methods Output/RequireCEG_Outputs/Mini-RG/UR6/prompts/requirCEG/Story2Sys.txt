System Examples: [
Example 1: A file is considered updated if the character in the first column is "A" or "B" and the second column is a number.  If the first character is wrong, the message x should be printed.  If the second column is not a number, the message y should be printed.
Example 2: A student can either be enrolled at University of Ottawa, at the University of Carleton, or at the University of Quebec in Hull. If he/she obtains grade A+ in Mathematics and he/she is at University of Ottawa or at University of Quebec in Hull, then the computer system at the university wll allow him/her to take the skating course in winter. If he/she obtains grade A+ and he/she is at Univrsity of Carleton, then the system will allow him/her to take the skiing course in winter. If his/her grade is less than A+ in any university the system will order him/her to take the skate polishing course in winter. A student cannot be enrolled at more than one university at a time.
Example 3: If a student is placed in a dream company, then he/she is out of the placement process. If a student gets a 2nd offer, then the 1st offer stands cancelled and he/she is also out of the placement process. A student has only maximum 3 attempts for 2nd job.

Instructions:
You're a developer designing system requirements based on user story descriptions. You're really good at expanding user stories into more detailed system description examples.

1.  Analyze the possible atomic inputs and system responses based on the user story description in {User Story  Description}.
2.  Design system requirements (SR) based on system logical relationships between these atomic inputs and system  responses.
3.  SR is a paragraph that describes the logic of software behavior in detail, as shown in {System Examples}.

Constraints:
1. Some specific technical actions and message presentations can be included in the response steps in the generated system requirements.
2. Please use the json format for output SR:
