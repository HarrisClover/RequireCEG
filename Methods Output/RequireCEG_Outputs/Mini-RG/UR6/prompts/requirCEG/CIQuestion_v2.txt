Atomic C and E: [
{Atomic Replacement Flag}
]

Logical Expressions: [
{CEG Replacement Flag}
]

Instructions:
Step 1: Intervene on conditional nodes (Cx) according to the order of expressions in the {Logical Expressions}.  By default, all condition nodes (Cx) are set to True.  Apply the intervention by setting each condition node to False in turn, represented as do(Cx=False).
Step 2: After each intervention on a condition (Cx), identify all {Logical Expressions} that depend on that condition.  Infer the effects of the intervention on all related expressions by analyzing how setting Cx=False impacts their truth value.  This step is crucial as it determines which expressions are no longer valid after the intervention.
Step 3: For each affected logical expression, use the corresponding meanings of conditions (C) and actions (E) from {Atomic C and E}.  Replace each affected expression with its specific meaning and generate a comprehensive natural language system description that reflects all changes caused by the intervention.

Constraints:
1. Ensure that all affected expressions are identified and replaced with their corresponding meanings from {Atomic C and E}.
2. The final output should contain a detailed natural language system description that accurately represents the impact of each intervention on all logical expressions.
3. The output format must be a JSON object where each QA step corresponds to an intervention. Use the following format:
{
  "QA n": {
    "do(Cx = False)": "Natural language system description"
  }
}
