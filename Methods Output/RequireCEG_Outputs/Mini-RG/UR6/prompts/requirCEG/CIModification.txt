Cause-Effect Graph Example: [
    System requirements: [A file is considered updated if the character in the first column is "A" or "B" and the second column is a number.  If the first character is wrong, the message x should be printed.  If the second column is not a number, the message y should be printed.]

    Atomic C and E:
    [
        C1: The character in column 1 is 'A',
        C2: The character in column 1 is "B",
        C3: The character in column 2 is a number,
        E1: The file update is complete,
        E2: Prints the message x,
        E3: Print the message y
    ]

    Cause-Effect Graph: [
        "Exp 1": AND (OR (C1, C2), C3) = E1,
        "Exp 2": NOT (C3) = E3,
        "Exp 3": NOT (OR (C1, C2)) = E2,
        "Exp 4": EXC (C1, C2)
    ]

Features of Cause-Effect Graph:
[
    The Causal Effect Graph consists of condition (Cause) nodes (C) and action (Effect) nodes (E) as well as relation edges (Relationship between atomic conditions  and atomic actions) and restriction relation edges (Restrictions between conditions/actions).
    
    Expressions with an equal sign (Relate C to E):
    1. DIR (Identity): If the condition (C) occurs, the action (E) is occur. If the condition does not occur, the action is not occur too.
        - Format: "Exp X": "DIR (C1) = E1"
        - Constraint: Must have one or more C.
        - Example: "Exp 1": "DIR (C1) = E1"

    2. AND: If all the conditions (Cs) occur, the action (E) occurs. If any condition (Cs) does not occur, the action (E) does not occur.
        - Format: "Exp X": "AND (C3, C4) = E3"
        - Constraint: Must have two or more Cs.
        - Example: "Exp 3": "AND (C3, C4) = E3"

    3. OR: If any one of the conditions (Cs) occurs, the action (E) occurs. If none occur, the action (E) does not occur.
        - Format: "Exp X": "OR (C5, C6) = E4"
        - Constraint: Must have two or more Cs.
        - Example: "Exp 4": "OR (C5, C6) = E4"
    
    4. NOT: If the condition (C) occurs, the action (E) does not occur. If the condition does not occur, the action is occur.
        - Format: "Exp X": "NOT (C2) = E2"
        - Constraint: Must have one or more C.
        - Example: "Exp 2": "NOT (C2) = E2"

    Expressions without an equal sign (Restrictions between C and C):
    1. EXC (Mutual Exclusion): The conditions (Cs) cannot occur simultaneously, but they can fail to occur simultaneously.
        - Format: "Exp X": "EXC (C9, C10)"
        - Constraint: Must have two or more Cs.
        - Example: "Exp 6": "EXC (C9, C10)"

    2. INC (Contains): At least one of the specified conditions (Cs) must occur.
        - Format: "Exp X": "INC (C11, C12)"
        - Constraint: Must have two or more Cs.
        - Example: "Exp 7": "INC (C11, C12)"

    3. REQ (Required Dependency): If the first condition occur and the second condition is occured at same time.
        - Format: "Exp X": "REQ (C7, C8)"
        - Constraint: Must have two or more Cs.
        - Example: "Exp 5": "REQ (C7, C8)"

    4. XOR (Exclusive OR): In the conditions (Cs), at least one must occur.
        - Format: "Exp X": "XOR (C13, C14)"
        - Constraint: Must have two or more Cs.
        - Example: "Exp 8": "XOR (C13, C14)"

    Expressions without an equal sign (Restrictions between E and E):
    1. MSK (Masking Dependency): If first action (E) occurs, second action (E) specified action must not occur. If the first action (E) does not occur, the second action (E) may or may not occur.
        - Format: "Exp X": "MSK (E5, E6)"
        - Constraint: Must have two or more Es.
        - Example: "Exp 9": "MSK (E5, E6)"

Instruction:
1. You're a software testing analyst.
2. Select the expression involved in the Affected_expressions and the Reason for the error from {Logical Expressions} based on {Error Expressions}.
3. Given {Atomic C and E}, modify the {Error Expression} involved in the error according to the error Reason described by {Error Expressions} to make it conform to the requirement logic in {System Requirement}.
4. If you want to select "NOT" relationship, be sure to distinguish it from "DIR (Identity)" carefully. NOT is C happens E does not happen, and DIR is C happens E happens.
5. If you want to select "REQ" restriction, make sure that the first symbol depends on the second one, and they must both occur at the same time. Don't mess with the order.

Constraints:
1. All {Error Expressions} involved in the error need to be modified !
2. Please use the JSON format for the expressions without any notes and any new keys:
{
 "Exp 1": ...,
 "Exp 2": ...,
 "Exp 3": ...,
 "Exp n": ...
}
