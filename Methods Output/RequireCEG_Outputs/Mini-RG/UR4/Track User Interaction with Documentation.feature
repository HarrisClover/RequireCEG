Feature: Track User Interaction with Documentation

  As a system administrator
  I want to monitor user interactions with the documentation page
  So that I can ensure users have access to effective resources for utilizing the web app

  Background:
    Given the documentation page is accessible and properly formatted
    And the system is set up to record user engagement

  Scenario: Scenario 1: User accesses documentation page
    Given a user visits the documentation page
    When the user interacts with the documentation content
    Then the engagement should be recorded in the system
    And a user-friendly message should be displayed indicating effective learning of the web app

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Documentation page is down
    Given the documentation page is unreachable
    When the user attempts to access the documentation
    Then the user should be notified that the documentation is unavailable

  Scenario: Scenario 3: User shows no interaction with documentation
    Given the user does not access the documentation whatsoever
    Then the system should determine that the user is likely uninformed about the web app's functionalities

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Minimal interaction metrics
    Given user engagement metrics reflect minimal interaction over a defined period
    Then the system should flag this for review
    And prompt administrators to consider updates for enhancing usability and clarity

  Scenario: Scenario 5: Documentation not accessible by the user
    Given the documentation page is experiencing downtime
    When the user attempts to access the documentation
    Then the user should be notified that documentation is unavailable

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Evaluate Documentation Accessibility
    Given the documentation page status is <status>
    And the user engagement metrics show <interaction-level>
    When the system evaluates user interactions
    Then the system responds with <response>
    Examples:
      | status | interaction-level | response |
      | accessible | high | recorded engagement and user-friendly message |
      | down | no interaction | notification of lack of access |
      | accessible | low | flag for review and prompt administrators |
