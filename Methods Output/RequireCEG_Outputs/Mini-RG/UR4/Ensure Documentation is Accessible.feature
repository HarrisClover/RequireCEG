Feature: Ensure Documentation is Accessible

  As a user of the web app
  I want to confirm that the user documentation is available and understandable
  So that I can effectively use the web app

  Background:
    Given the user navigates to the documentation page
    And the user is logged into the web app

  Scenario: Documentation is available and accessible
    Given the user documentation is present
    And the user documentation is fully accessible
    And the user documentation is rendered correctly
    When the user views the documentation
    Then the documentation should be clear and easy to understand
    And the user is notified that the documentation is available and accessible

  Scenario: Documentation is unavailable
    Given the user tries to access documentation
    When the documentation is not available
    Then the system displays a message indicating that the documentation is currently unavailable
    And the user is notified that the documentation is currently unavailable

  Scenario: Documentation page is down or inaccessible
    Given the user navigates to the documentation page
    When an issue arises that makes the documentation page down
    Then the system notifies the user with an error message about the inaccessibility of the documentation
    And the user is notified that the documentation page is down or inaccessible and cannot provide guidance

  Scenario: User documentation is not fully accessible
    Given the user documentation is present
    And the user documentation is rendered correctly
    When the user attempts to view partially accessible documentation
    Then the system should notify the user about the inaccessibility of parts of the documentation
    And the documentation must still retain some clarity and understanding
