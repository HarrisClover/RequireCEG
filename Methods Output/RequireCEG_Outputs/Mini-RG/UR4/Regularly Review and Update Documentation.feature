Feature: Regularly Review and Update Documentation

  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure the user documentation is up to date
  So that users receive accurate and helpful guidance on using the web app

  Background:
    Given the documentation status is checked each time it is accessed
    And there is a scheduled review process in place

  Scenario: Scenario 1: Documentation is up to date
    Given the documentation is current
    When a user accesses the documentation
    Then the user sees a well-organized page with clear instructions
    And the user can navigate the web app effectively

  Scenario: Scenario 2: Documentation is under review
    Given the documentation has been identified as out of date
    When a user accesses the documentation
    Then a message is displayed that the documentation is under review
    And the information may not reflect the current state of the web app

  Scenario: Scenario 3: Documentation is unavailable
    Given the documentation page is down or inaccessible
    When a user attempts to access the documentation
    Then an error message is presented informing the user of the unavailability

  Scenario: Scenario 4: Scheduled Review Process is implemented
    Given the documentation is regularly reviewed
    When the review process is conducted
    Then the documentation remains accurate and relevant
    And the review includes maintaining a record of updates

  Scenario Outline: Scenario Outline: Scheduled Review Frequency
    Given the documentation is reviewed every <review-frequency>
    And a record of updates is maintained <update-record>
    When reviews are conducted regularly
    Then the documentation remains accurate and relevant
    Examples:
      | review-frequency | update-record |
      | monthly | yes |
      | quarterly | no |
      | bi-annually | yes |
