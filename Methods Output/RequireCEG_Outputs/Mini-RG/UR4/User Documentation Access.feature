Feature: User Documentation Access

  As a user
  I want to access the user documentation page
  So that I can learn how to use the web app effectively

  Background:
    Given the user is logged into the system
    And the user navigates to the user documentation page

  Scenario: Page is available and visual aids are present
    Given the user documentation page is up and running
    When the user accesses the user documentation page
    Then the system displays relevant visual aids
    And the visual aids include screenshots and videos

  Scenario: Page is down
    Given the user documentation page is not available
    When the user attempts to access the user documentation page
    Then the system presents an error message indicating that the documentation is currently unavailable
    And the user is prevented from accessing any information including visual aids

  Scenario: User Feedback on Visual Aids
    Given the user has accessed the visual aids
    When the user finds the visual aids clear and comprehensible
    Then the system records user feedback on the clarity and comprehensibility of visual aids
    And the user can submit feedback for improvement

  Scenario: Visual Aids Missing
    Given the user documentation page is available
    And there are no visual aids present
    When the user accesses the user documentation page
    Then the user receives a notification about missing visual aids
    And the notification indicates possible confusion or uncertainty

  Scenario: Visual Aids available and user interacts with them
    Given the user documentation page is up and running
    And the visual aids are available
    When the user interacts with the visual aids
    Then the user finds the visual aids clear and comprehensible
    And the system allows for feedback submission for the continued improvement of documentation features
