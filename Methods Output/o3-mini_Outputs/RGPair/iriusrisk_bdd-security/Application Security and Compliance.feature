Feature: Application Security and Compliance

In order to ensure the application is secure from common vulnerabilities and adheres to industry security standards,
As a security engineer,
I want the system to perform automated security scans and enforce robust security controls.

Scenario: Automated Vulnerability Scanning with OWASP ZAP
Given the system is configured to initiate an automated security scanning process using OWASP ZAP
And the scanning policies are enabled with high attack strength and low alert thresholds
When a security scan is executed
Then the scan must identify and report any vulnerabilities including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, path traversal, remote file inclusion, server-side inclusion, code injection, remote OS command injection, and others
And no vulnerabilities rated medium or higher are present

Scenario: Enforcement of Security HTTP Headers
Given the system is designed to enforce security measures via HTTP headers
When a client interacts with the application
Then the response must include security headers such as X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Strict-Transport-Security
And these headers help protect against clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks

Scenario: Secure Session Management Controls
Given the system supports session management controls
When a user logs out or is inactive for a predefined time period
Then the session identifiers are invalidated
And session cookies must include the 'secure' and 'httpOnly' flags

Scenario: Strong SSL/TLS Configuration
Given the system is configured with SSL/TLS
When a client establishes a secure connection
Then weak protocols must be disabled
And only strong TLS versions and ciphers with perfect forward secrecy must be supported

Scenario: CORS Validation and Access Restriction
Given the application validates incoming CORS requests
When a cross-origin request is received
Then access must be restricted based on the user's authorization level
And unauthorized access to sensitive data is prevented

Scenario: Data Confidentiality and Secure Transmission
Given the application handles sensitive data
When sensitive information is transmitted
Then browser caching of the data must be prevented
And data must be transmitted using secure protocols to ensure confidentiality

Scenario: Robust User Authentication
Given the application implements user authentication mechanisms
When a user logs in
Then the system must enforce the use of case-sensitive passwords
And credentials must be transmitted over HTTPS to secure the communication
