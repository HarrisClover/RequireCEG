Feature: Environment and Cluster Management

In order to efficiently manage and deploy system resources
As a system operator
I want to be able to create, list, update, and delete environments and clusters; filter and track revisions; schedule deployments; and handle errors appropriately

Background: Given the system is running And the data service for environments and clusters is available

Environment Listing
Scenario: Listing environments for an existent cluster When I list environments for cluster "ClusterA" Then I should receive a non-empty list of environments with their details

Scenario: Listing environments for a non-existent cluster When I list environments for cluster "NonExistentCluster" Then I should receive an empty response

Scenario: Filtering environments by name prefix Given the following environments exist in cluster "ClusterA": | name | details | | env-production | version 1.0 | | env-staging | version 1.0 | | test-env | beta release | When I filter environments in cluster "ClusterA" by the prefix "env-" Then I should only see environments whose names start with "env-"

Environment Creation
Scenario: Creating a new environment in a new cluster When I create an environment named "env-production" in cluster "ClusterA" Then the environment "env-production" should be successfully created in "ClusterA"

Scenario: Rejecting duplicate environment creation in the same cluster Given an environment named "env-production" exists in cluster "ClusterA" When I attempt to create an environment named "env-production" in cluster "ClusterA" Then I should receive an error message stating "Environment already exists in this cluster"

Scenario: Allowing same environment name in different clusters Given an environment named "env-production" exists in cluster "ClusterA" When I create an environment named "env-production" in cluster "ClusterB" Then the environment "env-production" should be successfully created in "ClusterB"

Environment Updates and Revisions
Scenario: Updating an existing environment Given an environment named "env-production" exists in cluster "ClusterA" When I update environment "env-production" in cluster "ClusterA" with new configuration details Then the update should succeed And a new revision entry should be recorded for "env-production"

Scenario: Handling updates on a non-existent environment When I update environment "non-existent-env" in cluster "ClusterA" with some configuration changes Then I should receive an error message stating "Environment does not exist"

Environment Deletion
Scenario: Deleting a non-existent environment When I delete environment "non-existent-env" in cluster "ClusterA" Then I should receive an error message stating "Environment does not exist"

Tracking Environment Revisions
Scenario: Capturing environment revision history Given an environment "env-production" exists in cluster "ClusterA" When I update the environment with configuration change "version 2.0" Then the revision history for "env-production" should include an entry for "version 2.0" indicating a successful update

Cluster Management
Scenario: Listing clusters and associating environments Given clusters "ClusterA" and "ClusterB" exist And an environment "env-production" exists in "ClusterA" And an environment "env-staging" exists in "ClusterB" When I list all clusters Then I should see that "ClusterA" is associated with "env-production" And "ClusterB" is associated with "env-staging"

Deployment Task Scheduling
Scenario: Scheduling a deployment task without replacing up-to-date tasks Given a deployment task is scheduled for environment "env-production" in cluster "ClusterA" And the environment is already up-to-date When I schedule a deployment task for the same environment again Then the system should prevent a redundant replacement And return a message "Deployment task up-to-date"

Scenario: Handling deployment task failures efficiently Given a deployment task is scheduled for environment "env-production" When the deployment task fails due to a runtime error Then the system should capture the failure And provide an informative error message explaining the resource exception

Daemon Deployment Strategy
Scenario: Deploying a daemon using the Replace After Terminate strategy When I deploy a daemon for environment "env-production" in cluster "ClusterA" using the Replace After Terminate strategy Then the previous daemon instance should be terminated before the new instance is deployed And the deployment should be reported as successful
