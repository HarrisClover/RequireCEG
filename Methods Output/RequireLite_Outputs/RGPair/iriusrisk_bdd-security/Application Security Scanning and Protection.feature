Feature: Application Security Scanning and Protection

  As a system administrator
  I want to implement automated security scanning and enforce security measures
  So that the application is protected against various vulnerabilities and ensures data confidentiality

  Background:
    Given the scanning process is configured to identify vulnerabilities
    And security measures are enforced through proper HTTP headers

  Scenario: Validate Vulnerability Scanning
    Given the OWASP ZAP scanning tool is set up
    When the system undergoes a security scan
    Then no medium or higher risk vulnerabilities are present
    And a remediation plan is defined for any detected vulnerabilities

  Scenario: Ensure Secure HTTP Headers
    Given the application is configured with necessary HTTP headers
    When a request is made to the application
    Then the response includes X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Strict-Transport-Security headers

  Scenario Outline: Session Management Validation
    Given the user has logged into the system with valid credentials
    When the user logs out or becomes inactive for <inactive-duration>
    Then the session ID must be invalidated
    And the session cookies are configured with secure and httpOnly flags
    Examples:
      | timeout-period | inactive-duration |
      | 30 minutes | 15 minutes |
      | 15 minutes | 5 minutes |
      | 60 minutes | 30 minutes |


  Scenario: SSL Configuration Validation
    Given the application is served over HTTPS
    When the SSL configuration is validated
    Then only strong TLS versions and ciphers are supported
    And perfect forward secrecy is enabled

  Scenario: CORS Policy Check
    Given the application receives a CORS request
    When the CORS policy is applied based on defined user authorization levels
    Then cross-origin access is restricted based on the user's role and permissions

  Scenario: Data Confidentiality Enforcement
    Given the application handles sensitive data
    When a request is made for sensitive information
    Then browser caching of sensitive data is prevented
    And sensitive information is transmitted securely using encryption methods like TLS

  Scenario: User Authentication Mechanism
    Given the user attempts to log in
    When the user provides credentials
    Then the authentication checks enforce case-sensitive passwords
    And HTTPS is mandatory during credential transmission, verified through network analysis
