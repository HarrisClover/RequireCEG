Feature: User Interaction Simulation and Concurrency Handling
  As a system tester,
  I want to simulate user clicks and drag-and-drop actions, including login prerequisites and delays,
  So that I can verify the system handles these interactions correctly, even when potentially executed concurrently.

  Background:
    Given the user is interacting with the application

  Scenario Outline: Simulating Number Clicks with Delay
    When the user clicks on number <Number1>
    And the user clicks on number <Number2>
    And a delay of 1 second is introduced to simulate concurrent execution
    Then the system should confirm the click actions for <Number1> and <Number2> were successful

    Examples:
      | Number1 | Number2 |
      | 4       | 3       |
      | 1       | 2       |
      # Add more combinations as needed

  Scenario: Simulating Drag and Drop after Login with Delay
    Given the user needs to be logged in for drag-and-drop operations
    When the user successfully logs into the system
    And the user performs a drag-and-drop action from source element to target element
    And a delay of 1 second is introduced to simulate concurrent execution
    Then the system should confirm the drag-and-drop operation was successful
